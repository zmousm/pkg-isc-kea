// This is an example configuration file for DHCPv6 server in Kea.
// It attempts to showcase some of the more advanced features.
// Topology wise, it's a basic scenario with one IPv6 subnet configured.
// It is assumed that one subnet (2001:db8:1::/64) is available directly
// over ethX interface.
//
// The following features are currently showcased here:
// 1. Configuration of MAC/hardware address sources in DHCPv6
// 2. RSOO (Relay supplied options) - Some relays may insert options with the
//    intention for the server to insert them into client directed messages.
// 3. Control socket. Kea can open a socket and listen for incoming
//    commands.

// Kea 0.9.1 introduced MAC/hardware addresses support in DHCPv6. There is
// no single reliable method of getting MAC address information in DHCPv6.
// Kea supports several methods. Depending on your network set up, some
// methods may be more preferable than others, hence the configuration
// parameter. 'mac-sources' is a list of methods. Allowed parameters are:
// any, raw, duid, ipv6-link-local, client-link-addr-option, rfc6939 (which
// is an alias for client-link-addr-option), remote-id, rfc4649 (which is an
// alias for remote-id, subscriber-id, rfc4580 (which is an alias for
// subscriber-id) and docsis.
//
// Note that the order matters. Methods are attempted one by one in the order
// specified until hardware address is obtained. If you don't care which method
// is used, using 'any' is marginally faster than enumerating them all.
//
// If mac-sources are not specified, a default value of 'any' is used.

// RFC6422 defines a mechanism called relay-supplied options option. The relay
// agent may insert certain options that the server will echo back to the
// client, if certain criteria are met. One condition is that the option must
// be RSOO-enabled (i.e. allowed to be echoed back). IANA maintains a list
// of those options here:
// http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xhtml#options-relay-supplied
