      This document lists each message that can be logged by the
      programs in the Kea package.  Each entry in this manual
      is of the form:
      </p><pre class="screen">IDENTIFICATION message-text</pre><p>
      ... where "IDENTIFICATION" is the message identification included
      in each message logged and "message-text" is the accompanying
      message text.  The "message-text" may include placeholders of the
      form "%1", "%2" etc.; these parameters are replaced by relevant
      values when the message is logged.
    </p><p>
      Each entry is also accompanied by a description giving more
      information about the circumstances that result in the message
      being logged.
    </p><p>
      For information on configuring and using Kea logging,
      refer to the <a class="ulink" href="kea-guide.html" target="_top">Kea Guide</a>.

This debug message is logged when the allocation engine successfully
reclaims a lease. The lease is now available for assignment.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_REMOVAL_NCR_FAILED"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_REMOVAL_NCR_FAILED sending removal name change request failed for lease %1: %2</span></dt><dd><p>
This error message is logged when sending a removal name change request
to DHCP DDNS failed. This name change request is usually generated when
the lease reclamation routine acts upon expired leases. If a lease being
reclaimed has a corresponding DNS entry it needs to be removed.
This message indicates that removal of the DNS entry has failed.
Nevertheless the lease will be reclaimed.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_ALLOC_ERROR"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_ALLOC_ERROR %1: error during attempt to allocate an IPv4 address: %2</span></dt><dd><p>
An error occurred during an attempt to allocate an IPv4 address, the
reason for the failure being contained in the message.  The server will
return a message to the client refusing a lease. The first argument
includes the client identification information.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_ALLOC_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_ALLOC_FAIL %1: failed to allocate an IPv4 address after %2 attempt(s)</span></dt><dd><p>
The DHCP allocation engine gave up trying to allocate an IPv4 address
after the specified number of attempts.  This probably means that the
address pool from which the allocation is being attempted is either
empty, or very nearly empty.  As a result, the client will have been
refused a lease. The first argument includes the client identification
information.
</p><p>
This message may indicate that your address pool is too small for the
number of clients you are trying to service and should be expanded.
Alternatively, if the you know that the number of concurrently active
clients is less than the addresses you have available, you may want to
consider reducing the lease lifetime.  In this way, addresses allocated
to clients that are no longer active on the network will become available
sooner.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_DECLINED_RECOVERED"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_DECLINED_RECOVERED IPv4 address %1 was recovered after %2 seconds of probation-period</span></dt><dd><p>
This informational message indicates that the specified address was reported
as duplicate (client sent DECLINE) and the server marked this address as
unvailable for a period of time. This time now has elapsed and the address
has been returned to the available pool. This step concludes decline recovery
process.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_DISCOVER_ADDRESS_CONFLICT"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_DISCOVER_ADDRESS_CONFLICT %1: conflicting reservation for address %2 with existing lease %3</span></dt><dd><p>
This warning message is issued when the DHCP server finds that the
address reserved for the client can't be offered because this address
is currently allocated to another client. The server will try to allocate
a different address to the client to use until the conflict is resolved.
The first argument includes the client identification information.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_DISCOVER_HR"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_DISCOVER_HR client %1 sending DHCPDISCOVER has reservation for the address %2</span></dt><dd><p>
This message is issued when the allocation engine determines that the
client sending the DHCPDISCOVER has a reservation for the specified
address. The allocation engine will try to offer this address to
the client.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASES_RECLAMATION_COMPLETE"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASES_RECLAMATION_COMPLETE reclaimed %1 leases in %2</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is logged when the allocation engine completes
reclamation of a set of expired leases. The maximum number of leases
to be reclaimed in a single pass of the lease reclamation routine
is configurable using 'max-reclaim-leases' parameter. However,
the number of reclaimed leases may also be limited by the timeout
value, configured with 'max-reclaim-time'. The message includes the
number of reclaimed leases and the total time.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASES_RECLAMATION_SLOW"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASES_RECLAMATION_SLOW expired leases still exist after %1 reclamations</span></dt><dd><p>
This warning message is issued when the server has been unable to
reclaim all expired leases in a specified number of consecutive
attempts. This indicates that the value of "reclaim-timer-wait-time"
may be too high. However, if this is just a short burst of leases'
expirations the value does not have to be modified and the server
should deal with this in subsequent reclamation attempts. If this
is a result of a permanent increase of the server load, the value
of "reclaim-timer-wait-time" should be decreased, or the
values of "max-reclaim-leases" and "max-reclaim-time" should be
increased to allow processing more leases in a single cycle.
Alternatively, these values may be set to 0 to remove the
limitations on the number of leases and duration. However, this
may result in longer periods of server's unresponsiveness to
DHCP packets, while it processes the expired leases.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASES_RECLAMATION_START"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASES_RECLAMATION_START starting reclamation of expired leases (limit = %1 leases or %2 milliseconds)</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is issued when the allocation engine starts the
reclamation of the expired leases. The maximum number of leases to
be reclaimed and the timeout is included in the message. If any of
these values is 0, it means "unlimited".
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASES_RECLAMATION_TIMEOUT"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASES_RECLAMATION_TIMEOUT timeout of %1 ms reached while reclaiming IPv4 leases</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is issued when the allocation engine hits the
timeout for performing reclamation of the expired leases. The
reclamation will now be interrupted and all leases which haven't
been reclaimed, because of the timeout, will be reclaimed when the
next scheduled reclamation is started. The argument is the timeout
value expressed in milliseconds.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASE_RECLAIM"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_LEASE_RECLAIM %1: reclaiming expired lease for address %2</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is issued when the server begins reclamation of the
expired DHCPv4 lease. The first argument specifies the client identification
information. The second argument holds the leased IPv4 address.

This error message is logged when the allocation engine fails to
reclaim an expired lease. The reason for the failure is included in the
message. The error may be triggered in the lease expiration hook or
while performing the operation on the lease database.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_NO_MORE_EXPIRED_LEASES"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_NO_MORE_EXPIRED_LEASES all expired leases have been reclaimed</span></dt><dd><p>

This message is issued when the allocation engine determines that
the client has a lease in the lease database, it doesn't have
reservation for any other lease, and the leased address is not
reserved for any other client. The allocation engine will try
to offer the same lease to the client.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_OFFER_NEW_LEASE"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_OFFER_NEW_LEASE allocation engine will try to offer new lease to the client %1</span></dt><dd><p>
This message is issued when the allocation engine will try to
offer a new lease to the client. This is the case when the
client doesn't have any existing lease, it has no reservation
or the existing or reserved address is leased to another client.
Also, the client didn't specify a hint, or the address in
the hint is in use.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_OFFER_REQUESTED_LEASE"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_OFFER_REQUESTED_LEASE allocation engine will try to offer requested lease %1 to the client %2</span></dt><dd><p>

offer the lease specified in the hint. This situation may occur
when: (a) client doesn't have any reservations, (b) client has
reservation but the reserved address is leased to another client.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_RECLAIMED_LEASES_DELETE"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_RECLAIMED_LEASES_DELETE begin deletion of reclaimed leases expired more than %1 seconds ago</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is issued when the allocation engine begins
deletion of the reclaimed leases which have expired more than
a specified number of seconds ago. This operation is triggered
periodically according to the "flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time"
parameter. The "hold-reclaimed-time" parameter defines a number
of seconds for which the leases are stored before they are
removed.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_RECLAIMED_LEASES_DELETE_COMPLETE"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_RECLAIMED_LEASES_DELETE_COMPLETE successfully deleted %1 expired-reclaimed leases</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is issued when the server successfully deletes
"expired-reclaimed" leases from the lease database. The number of
deleted leases is included in the log message.

to allocate (or reuse an expired) address which has been
requested by the client. The first argument includes the
client identification information.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_REQUEST_EXTEND_LEASE"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_REQUEST_EXTEND_LEASE %1: extending lifetime of the lease for address %2</span></dt><dd><p>
This message is issued when the allocation engine determines
that the client already has a lease whose lifetime can be
extended, and which can be returned to the client.
The first argument includes the client identification information.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_REQUEST_INVALID"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_REQUEST_INVALID client %1 having a reservation for address %2 is requesting invalid address %3</span></dt><dd><p>
This message is logged when the client, having a reservation for
one address, is requesting a different address. The client is
only allowed to do this when the reserved address is in use by
another client. However, the allocation engine has
determined that the reserved address is available and the
client should request the reserved address.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_REQUEST_IN_USE"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_REQUEST_IN_USE %1: requested address %2 is in use</span></dt><dd><p>

reservation for an address which is in use. The first argument
includes the client identification information.
</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_REQUEST_OUT_OF_POOL"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_REQUEST_OUT_OF_POOL client %1, which doesn't have a reservation, requested address %2 out of the dynamic pool</span></dt><dd><p>
This message is issued when the client has requested allocation
of the address which doesn't belong to any address pool from
which addresses are dynamically allocated. The client also
doesn't have reservation for this address. This address
could only be allocated if the client had reservation for it.

</p></dd><dt><a name="ALLOC_ENGINE_V6_ALLOC_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ALLOC_ENGINE_V6_ALLOC_FAIL %1: failed to allocate an IPv6 address after %2 attempt(s)</span></dt><dd><p>
The DHCP allocation engine gave up trying to allocate an IPv6 address
after the specified number of attempts.  This probably means that the
address pool from which the allocation is being attempted is either
empty, or very nearly empty.  As a result, the client will have been
refused a lease. The first argument includes the client identification
information.
</p><p>
This message may indicate that your address pool is too small for the
number of clients you are trying to service and should be expanded.
Alternatively, if the you know that the number of concurrently active

This message is logged when the allocation engine is in the process of
allocating leases for the client, it found existing leases and static
reservations for the client. The allocation engine will verify if
existing leases match reservations. Those leases that are reserved for
other clients and those that are not reserved for the client will
be removed. All leases matching the reservations will be renewed
and returned.

</p></dd><dt><a name="ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">ASIODNS_TCP_CLOSE_FAIL failed to close DNS/TCP socket with a client: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
A TCP DNS server tried to close a TCP socket used to communicate with
a client, but it failed to do that.  While closing a socket should
normally be an error-free operation, there have been known cases where
this happened with a "connection reset by peer" error.  This might be
because of some odd client behavior, such as sending a TCP RST after
establishing the connection and before the server closes the socket,
but how exactly this could happen seems to be system dependent (i.e,
it's not part of the standard socket API), so it's difficult to
provide a general explanation.  In any case, it is believed that an
error on closing a socket doesn't mean leaking system resources (the
kernel should clean up any internal resource related to the socket,
just reporting an error detected in the close call), but, again, it
seems to be system dependent.  This message is logged at a debug level
as it's known to happen and could be triggered by a remote node and it
would be better to not be too verbose, but you might want to increase
the log level and make sure there's no resource leak or other system
level troubles when it's logged.

This debug message is issued when the server is processing the DHCPv4 message
for which client identifier will not be used when allocating new lease or
renewing existing lease. The server is explicitly configured to not use
client identifier to lookup existing leases for the client and will not
record client identifier in the lease database. This mode of operation
is useful when clients don't use stable client identifiers, e.g. multi
stage booting. Note that the client identifier may be used for other
operations than lease allocation, e.g. identifying host reservations
for the client using client identifier. The first argument includes the
client and transaction identification information. The second argument

</p><p>
This debug message is issued when the server is trying to send the
response to the client. When the server is using an UDP socket
to send the packet there are cases when this operation may be
unsuccessful and no error message will be displayed. One such situation
occurs when the server is unicasting the response to the 'ciaddr' of
a DHCPINFORM message. This often requires broadcasting an ARP
message to obtain the link layer address of the unicast destination.
If broadcast ARP messages are blocked in the network, according to
the firewall policy, the ARP message will not cause a response.
Consequently, the response to the DHCPINFORM will not be sent.
Since the ARP communication is under the OS control, Kea is not
notified about the drop of the packet which it is trying to send
and it has no means to display an error message.

This informational message is printed when a client tried to decline an address,
but the server has no lease for said address. This means that the server's
and client's perception of the leases are different. The likely causes
of this could be: a confused (e.g. skewed clock) or broken client (e.g. client
moved to a different location and didn't notice) or possibly an attack
(a rogue client is trying to decline random addresses). The server will
inform the client that his decline request was rejected and client should
be able to recover from that.

This informational message indicates that the client leased an address, but
discovered that it is being used by some other device and reported this to the
server by sending a Decline message. The server marked the lease as
declined. This likely indicates a misconfiguration in the network. Either
the server is configured with an incorrect pool or there are devices that have
statically assigned addresses that are supposed to be assigned by the DHCP
server. Both client (will request a different address) and server (will recover
the lease after decline-probation-time elapses) will recover automatically.
However, if the underlying problem is not solved, the conditions leading
