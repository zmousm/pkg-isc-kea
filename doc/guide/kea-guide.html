      Kea is the next generation of DHCP software developed by ISC.
      It supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 protocols along with their
      extensions, e.g. prefix delegation and dynamic updates to DNS.
    </p><p>
      Kea was initially developed as a part of the BIND 10 framework.
      In early 2014, ISC made the decision to discontinue active
      development of BIND 10 and continue development of Kea as
      standalone DHCP software.
    </p><p>
      This guide covers Kea version 1.4.0-beta.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp49243840"></a>1.1.Â Supported Platforms</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Kea is officially supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
	    CentOS, Fedora and FreeBSD systems. It is also likely to work on many
	    other platforms: Kea 1.3.0 builds have been tested on (in no
        particular order) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4, Debian GNU/Linux 7,
        Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora 22, Fedora 25, CentOS Linux 7,
        FreeBSD 11.0 OS X 10.11, OS X 10.12, Debian 7.11
      </p><p>There are currently no plans to port Kea to Windows platforms.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="required-software"></a>1.2.Â Required Software at Run-time</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Running Kea uses various extra software which may
        not be provided in the default installation of some operating systems,
        nor in the standard package collections. You may
        need to install this required software separately.

              For instructions concerning the installation and configuration
              of database backends for Kea, see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp-install-configure" title="3.6.Â DHCP Database Installation and Configuration">SectionÂ 3.6, âDHCP Database Installation and Configurationâ</a>.

              <a class="xref" href="#dhcp-config-backend" title="3.5.Â Selecting the Configuration Backend">SectionÂ 3.5, âSelecting the Configuration Backendâ</a>.
            </p></div><p>
        </p><p>
          For example, the following command configures Kea to find the
          Boost headers in /usr/pkg/include, specifies that PostgreSQL
          support should be enabled, and sets the installation location
          to /opt/kea:

          </p><pre class="screen">$ <strong class="userinput"><code>./configure \
      --with-boost-include=/usr/pkg/include \
      --with-pgsql=/usr/local/bin/pg_config \
      --prefix=/opt/kea</code></strong></pre><p>
        </p><p>
          If you have some problems with building Kea using the header-only
          Boost code or you'd like to use the Boost system library
          (assumed for the sake of this example to be located in /usr/pkg/lib):

          </p><pre class="screen">$ <strong class="userinput"><code>./configure \
      --with-boost-libs=-lboost_system \
      --with-boost-lib-dir=/usr/pkg/lib</code></strong></pre><p>
        </p><p>
          If <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> fails, it may be due to missing or old
          dependencies.
        </p><p>
          If <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> succeeds, it displays a report
          with the parameters used to build the code. This report is saved into
          the file <code class="filename">config.report</code> and is also embedded into
          the executable binaries, e.g., <strong class="userinput"><code>kea-dhcp4</code></strong>.

          After the configure step is complete, build the executables
          from the C++ code and prepare the Python scripts by running the command:
          </p><pre class="screen">$ <strong class="userinput"><code>make</code></strong></pre><p>

          and documentation, issue the command:
          </p><pre class="screen">$ <strong class="userinput"><code>make install</code></strong></pre><p>
        </p><p>
          Do not use any form of parallel or job server options
          (such as GNU make's <span class="command"><strong>-j</strong></span> option) when
          performing this step: doing so may cause errors.
        </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The install step may require superuser privileges.</p></div><p>

        Kea stores its leases in a lease database.  The software has been
        written in a way that makes it possible to choose which database product
        should be used to store the lease information.  At present, Kea supports
        four database backends: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra and Memfile. To
        limit external dependencies, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Cassandra support are
        disabled by default and only Memfile is available. Support for the
        optional external database backend must be explicitly included when Kea
        is built.  This section covers the building of Kea with one of the
        optional backends and the creation of the lease database.

      Kea supports storing leases and host reservations (i.e. static
      assignments of addresses, prefixes and options) in one of
      the several supported databases. As future versions of Kea
      are released, the structure of those databases will change.
      For example, Kea currently only stores lease information
      and host reservations. Future versions of Kea will store
      additional data such as subnet definitions: the database
      structure will need to be updated to accommodate the extra
      information.
    </p><p>
      A given version of Kea expects a particular structure in
      the database and checks for this by examining the version of
      database it is using.  Separate version numbers are maintained for
      backend databases, independent of the version of Kea itself. It
      is possible that the backend database version will stay the same
      through several Kea revisions: similarly, it is possible that the
      version of backend database may go up several revisions during a
      Kea upgrade.  Versions for each database are independent, so an
      increment in the MySQL database version does not imply an increment
      in that of PostgreSQL.
    </p><p>
      Backend versions are specified in
      a <em class="replaceable"><code>major.minor</code></em> format. The minor
      number is increased when there are backward compatible changes
      introduced.  For example, the addition of a new index. It is
      desirable, but not mandatory to apply such a change; you
      can run on older database version if you want to. (Although, in
      the example given, running without the new index may be at the
      expense of a performance penalty.) On the other hand, the major
      number is increased when an incompatible change is introduced,
      for example an extra column is added to a table. If you try to
      run Kea software on a database that is too old (as signified by
      mismatched backend major version number), Kea will refuse to run:
      administrative action will be required to upgrade the database.

      To manage the databases, Kea provides the
      <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin</strong></span> tool. It is able to initialize
      a new database, check its version number, perform a
      database upgrade, and dump lease data to a text file.
    </p><p>
      <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin</strong></span> takes two mandatory
      parameters: <span class="command"><strong>command</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>backend</strong></span>. Additional, non-mandatory options
      may be specified. Currently supported commands are:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>lease-init</strong></span> â
            Initializes a new lease database. This is useful during a new
            Kea installation. The database is initialized to the
            latest version supported by the version of the software being
            installed.
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>lease-version</strong></span> â

            each backend has its own versioning scheme.
          </li><li class="listitem">

            line of the file contains the column names.  This is meant to be
            used as a diagnostic tool, so it provides a portable, human-readable
            form of the lease data.
          </li></ul></div><p>

      <span class="command"><strong>backend</strong></span> specifies the backend type. Currently

        The memfile backend is able to store lease information, but is not able to

        this backend.)
      </p><p>
        No special initialization steps are necessary

        <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp4</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp6</strong></span>
        will create an empty lease file if one is not
        present. Necessary disk write permission is required.

        There are no special steps required to upgrade memfile lease files
        from an earlier version of Kea to a new version of Kea.

        During startup the servers will check the schema version of the lease
        files against their own.  If there is a mismatch, the servers will
        automatically launch the LFC process to convert the files to the
        server's schema version.  While this mechanism is primarily meant to
        ease the process of upgrading to newer versions of Kea, it can also
        be used for downgrading should the need arise.  When upgrading, any
        values not present in the original lease files will be assigned
        appropriate default values.  When downgrading, any data present in
        the files but not in the server's schema will be dropped.

        If you wish to convert the files manually, prior to starting the
        servers you may do so by running the LFC process yourself.
        See <a class="xref" href="#kea-lfc" title="ChapterÂ 12.Â The LFC process">ChapterÂ 12, <i>The LFC process</i></a> for more information.

          If you are setting the MySQL database for the first time,
          you need to create the database area within MySQL and set up
          the MySQL user ID under which Kea will access the database.
          This needs to be done manually: <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin</strong></span>
          is not able to do this for you.
        </p><p>
          To create the database:

          </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>

              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                Create the user under which Kea will access the database
                (and give it a password), then grant it access to the

                above are required.)
              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                At this point, you may elect to create the database
                tables. (Alternatively, you can exit MySQL and create
                the tables using the <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin</strong></span> tool,

                (<em class="replaceable"><code>path-to-kea</code></em> is the

          If you elected not to create the tables in step 4, you can do

          (Do not do this if you did create the tables in step 4.)
          <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin</strong></span> implements rudimentary checks:
          it will refuse to initialize a database that contains any
          existing tables. If you want to start from scratch, you
          must remove all data manually. (This process is a manual
          operation on purpose to avoid possibly irretrievable mistakes
          by <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin</strong></span>.)

          Sometimes a new Kea version may use newer database schema, so
          there will be a need to upgrade the existing database. This can
          be done using the <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin lease-upgrade</strong></span>
          command.
        </p><p>
          To check the current version of the database, use the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">

          about versioning.)  If the version does not match the minimum
          required for the new version of Kea (as described in the
          release notes), the database needs to be upgraded.
        </p><p>
          Before upgrading, please make sure that the database is
          backed up.  The upgrade process does not discard any data but,
          depending on the nature of the changes, it may be impossible
          to subsequently downgrade to an earlier version.  To perform
          an upgrade, issue the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">

        PostgreSQL is able to store leases, host reservations and options

        A PostgreSQL database must be set up if you want Kea to store

                Kea uses password authentication when connecting to
                the database and must have the appropriate entries
                added to PostgreSQL's pg_hba.conf file.  This file is
                normally located in the primary data directory for your
                PostgreSQL server. The precise path may vary but the
                default location for PostgreSQL 9.3 on Centos 6.5 is:

                Assuming Kea is running on the same host as PostgreSQL,
                adding lines similar to following should be sufficient to

          The lease expiration time is stored in the SQL database for each lease
          as a timestamp value. Kea developers observed that MySQL database doesn't
          accept timestamps beyond 2147483647 seconds (maximum signed 32-bit number)
          from the beginning of the epoch. At the same time, some versions of PostgreSQL
          do accept greater values but the value is altered when it is read back.
          For this reason the lease database backends put the restriction for the
          maximum timestamp to be stored in the database, which is equal to the
          maximum signed 32-bit number. This effectively means that the current
          Kea version can't store the leases which expiration time is later than
          2147483647 seconds since the beginning of the epoch (around year 2038).
          This will be fixed when the database support for longer timestamps
          is available.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp56070048"></a>4.3.6.2.Â Server Terminates when Database Connection is Lost</h4></div></div></div><p>
          If Kea is configured to use an external database it opens a connection
          to the database and requires that this connection is not interrupted.
          When the database connection breaks, e.g. as a result of SQL server
          restart, DHCP servers will terminate indicating a fatal error. In such
          a case, the system administrator is required to start the database and
          then "manually" start Kea to resume the service.
        </p><p>
          Although the engineering team is planning to implement some form of
          reconnect mechanism in the future, this will mostly be applicable in
          cases when the database service is restarted and the connection
          down time is relatively short. The DHCP server can't provide its
          service as long as the database is down, because it can't store
          leases being assigned to the clients. The server will have to
          reject any DHCP messages as long as the connection is down and
          terminate if the reconnection attempt fails multiple times.
        </p><p>
          Because the database connection is critical for the operation of the
          DHCP service, the current behavior is to terminate when that
          connection is unavailable to indicate that server is in inconsistent
          state and can't serve clients.

        Depending on requirements, not all of the available servers need
        be run.  The keactrl configuration file sets which servers are
        enabled and which are disabled.  The default configuration

        The <em class="parameter"><code>dhcp4</code></em>, <em class="parameter"><code>dhcp6</code></em>,
        <em class="parameter"><code>dhcp_ddns</code></em> and <em class="parameter"><code>ctrl_agent</code></em>
        parameters set to "yes" configure <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> to manage
        (start, reconfigure) all servers, i.e. <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp4</strong></span>,
        <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp6</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp-ddns</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>kea-ctrl-agent</strong></span>. When any of these parameters is set
        to "no" the <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> will ignore
        the corresponding server when starting or reconfiguring Kea.
      </p><p>
        By default, Kea servers managed by <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> are
        located in <code class="filename">[kea-install-dir]/sbin</code>. This
        should work for most installations. If the default
        location needs to be altered for any reason, the paths
        specified with the <em class="parameter"><code>dhcp4_srv</code></em>,
        <em class="parameter"><code>dhcp6_srv</code></em>, <em class="parameter"><code>dhcp_ddns_srv</code></em>
        and <em class="parameter"><code>ctrl_agent_srv</code></em> parameters should be modified.
      </p><p>
        The <em class="parameter"><code>kea_verbose</code></em> parameter specifies the verbosity
        of the servers being started. When <em class="parameter"><code>kea_verbose</code></em>
        is set to "yes" the logging level of the server is set to DEBUG.
        Modification of the logging severity in a configuration file, as
        described in <a class="xref" href="#logging" title="ChapterÂ 18.Â Logging">ChapterÂ 18, <i>Logging</i></a>, will have no effect as long
        as the <em class="parameter"><code>kea_verbose</code></em> is set to "yes". Setting
        it to "no" will cause the server to use the logging levels specified
        in the Kea configuration file for respective loggers. If no
        logging configuration is specified, the default settings will be
        used.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
          The verbosity for the server is set  when it is started. Once
          started, the verbosity can be only changed by stopping the server and
          starting it again with the new value of the
          <em class="parameter"><code>kea_verbose</code></em> parameter.

        </li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>Typical output from <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> when starting
      the servers looks similar to the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>$ keactrl start</code></strong>

INFO/keactrl: Starting kea-ctrl-agent -c /usr/local/etc/kea/kea-ctrl-agent.conf -d
</pre><p>
      </p><p>Kea's servers create PID files upon startup. These files are used
      by keactrl to determine whether or not a given server is running.  If
      one or more servers are running when the start command is issued, the
      output will look similar to the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>$ keactrl start</code></strong>
INFO/keactrl: kea-dhcp4 appears to be running, see: PID 10918, PID file: /usr/local/var/kea/kea.kea-dhcp4.pid.

</pre><p>
      During normal shutdowns these PID files are deleted. They may, however,
      be left over as remnants following a system crash.  It is possible,
      though highly unlikely, that upon system restart the PIDs they contain
      actually refer to processes unrelated to Kea.  This condition will cause
      keactrl to decide that the servers are running, when in fact they are
      not.  In such a case the PID files as listed in the keactrl output
      must be manually deleted.
      </p><p>The following command stops all servers:
</p><pre class="screen">

      Note that the <span class="command"><strong>stop</strong></span> will attempt to stop all servers
      regardless of whether they are "enabled" in the <code class="filename">keactrl.conf</code>.
      If any of the servers are not running, an informational message

        As already mentioned, the reconfiguration of each Kea server is
        triggered by the SIGHUP signal. The <span class="command"><strong>reload</strong></span>
        command sends the SIGHUP signal to the servers that are enabled in
        the <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> configuration file and are
        currently running. When a server receives the SIGHUP signal it
        re-reads its configuration file and, if the new configuration is
        valid, uses the new configuration. A reload is executed as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">

        The optional <span class="command"><strong>-s</strong></span> switch allows
        the selection of the servers to which <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span>
        command is issued.  For example, the following
        instructs <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> to stop the
        <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp4</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp6</strong></span> servers
        and leave the <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp-ddns</strong></span> and

</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>$ keactrl stop -s dhcp4,dhcp6</code></strong>
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        Similarly, the following
        will only start the <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp4</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp-ddns</strong></span> servers and not:
        <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp6</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>kea-ctrl-agent</strong></span>.
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>$ keactrl start -s dhcp4,dhcp_ddns</code></strong>

        Note that the behavior of the <span class="command"><strong>-s</strong></span> switch
        with the <span class="command"><strong>start</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>reload</strong></span> commands
        is different to its behavior with the <span class="command"><strong>stop</strong></span> command.
        On <span class="command"><strong>start</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>reload</strong></span>,
        <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> will check if the servers given as

    exposes a RESTful control interface for managing Kea servers. The daemon
    can receive control commands over HTTP and either forward these commands
    to the respective Kea servers or handle these commands on its own. The
    determination whether the command should be handled by the CA or forwarded
    is made by checking the value of the 'service' parameter which may be
    included in the command from the controlling client. The details of the
    supported commands as well as their structures are provided in
    <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel" title="ChapterÂ 16.Â Management API">ChapterÂ 16, <i>Management API</i></a>.</p><p>Hook libraries can be attached to the CA to provide support for
    additional commands or custom behavior of existing commands. Such hook
    libraries must implement callouts for 'control_command_receive' hook point.
    Details about creating new hook libraries and supported hook points can be
    found in
    <a class="ulink" href="https://jenkins.isc.org/job/Kea_doc/doxygen/" target="_top">Kea Developer's Guide</a>.
    </p><p>
      The CA processes received commands according to the following algorithm:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            Pass command into any installed hooks (regardless of service value(s)).
            If the command is handled by a hook, return the response.
          </li><li class="listitem">
            If the service specifies one more or services, the CA will forward the
            command to specified services and return the accumulated responses.
          </li><li class="listitem">
            If service is not specified or is an empty list, the CA will handle
            the command if it supports it.

      The <span class="command"><strong>http-host</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>http-port</strong></span>
      specify an IP address and port to which HTTP service will be bound.
      In case of the example configuration provided above, the RESTful
      service will be available under the URL of
      <span class="command"><strong>http://10.20.30.40:8080/</strong></span>. If these parameters
      are not specified, the default URL is http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    </p><p>
      It has been mentioned in the <a class="xref" href="#agent-overview" title="7.1.Â Overview">SectionÂ 7.1, âOverviewâ</a> that
      CA can forward received commands to the specific Kea servers for
      processing. For example, <span class="command"><strong>config-get</strong></span> is sent to
      retrieve configuration of one of the Kea services. When CA receives
      this command, including a <span class="command"><strong>service</strong></span> parameter
      indicating that the client desires to retrieve configuration of
      the DHCPv4 server, the CA will forward this command to this server
      and then pass the received response back to the client. More about
      the <span class="command"><strong>service</strong></span> parameter and general structure of
      the commands can be found in <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel" title="ChapterÂ 16.Â Management API">ChapterÂ 16, <i>Management API</i></a>.
    </p><p>
      The CA uses unix domain sockets to forward control commands and receive
      responses from other Kea services. The <span class="command"><strong>dhcp4</strong></span>,
      <span class="command"><strong>dhcp6</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>d2</strong></span> maps
      specify the files to which unix domain sockets are bound. In case
      of the configuration above, the CA will connect to the DHCPv4 server
      via <code class="filename">/path/to/the/unix/socket-v4</code> to forward the
      commands to it. Obviously, the DHCPv4 server must be configured to
      listen to connections via this same socket. In other words, the command
      socket configuration for the DHCPv4 server and CA (for this server)
      must match. Consult the <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-ctrl-channel" title="8.9.Â Management API for the DHCPv4 Server">SectionÂ 8.9, âManagement API for the DHCPv4 Serverâ</a> and the
      <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-ctrl-channel" title="9.13.Â Management API for the DHCPv6 Server">SectionÂ 9.13, âManagement API for the DHCPv6 Serverâ</a> to learn how the socket
      configuration is specified for the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 services.

        We have renamed "dhcp4-server", "dhcp6-server" and "d2-server"
        to "dhcp4", "dhcp6" and "d2" respectively after release of Kea 1.2.
        If you are migrating from Kea 1.2 you need to tweak your CA config
        to use this new naming convention. We have made this incompatible
        change to facilitate future use cases where it will be possible to
        specify additional values of the "service" parameter to point to
        the particular instances of the Kea servers, e.g. "dhcp4/3"
        pointing to the 3rd instance of the DHCPv4 server in the
        multi-processed configuration. This is not yet supported but the
        current renaming lays the ground for it.
      </p></div><p>
      User contexts can store arbitrary data as long as it is valid JSON
      syntax and its top level element is a map (i.e. the data must be
      enclosed in curly brackets). Some hook libraries may expect specific
      formatting, though.  Please consult specific hook library
      documentation for details.
    </p><p>
      User contexts can be specified on either global scope, control
      socket and loggers. One other useful usage is the ability to
      store comments or descriptions: the parser translates a
      "comment" entry into a user-context with the entry, this allows
      to attach a comment inside the configuration itself.
    </p><p>
      Hooks libraries can be attached to the Control Agent just like to
      DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers. It currently supports one hook point
      'control_command_receive' which makes it possible to delegate
      processing of some commands to the hooks library. The
      <span class="command"><strong>hooks-libraries</strong></span> list contains the list of hooks
      libraries that should be loaded by the CA, along with their configuration
      information specified with <span class="command"><strong>parameters</strong></span>.
    </p><p>
      Please consult <a class="xref" href="#logging" title="ChapterÂ 18.Â Logging">ChapterÂ 18, <i>Logging</i></a> for the details how to
      configure logging. The CA's root logger's name is
      <span class="command"><strong>kea-ctrl-agent</strong></span> as given in the example above.

      Control Agent doesn't natively support secure HTTP connections like

      two major HTTP server implentations working as a reverse proxy:
      Apache2 and nginx. Example configurations including extensive
      comments are provided in the <code class="filename">doc/examples/https/</code>
      directory.
    </p><p>
      The reverse proxy forwards HTTP requests received over secure
      connection to the Control Agent using (not secured) HTTP. Typically,
      the reverse proxy and the Control Agent are running on the same machine,
      but it is possible to configure them to run on separate machines as
      well. In this case, security depends on the protection of the
      communications between the reverse proxy and the Control Agent.
    </p><p>Apart from providing the encryption layer for the control channel,
    a reverse proxy server is also often used for authentication of the
    controlling clients. In this case, the client must present a valid
    certificate when it connects via reverse proxy. The proxy server
    authenticates the client by checking if the presented certificate is
    signed by the certificate authority used by the server.</p><p>To illustrate this, we provide a sample configuration for the
    nginx server running as a reverse proxy to the Kea Control Agent.
    The server enables authentication of the clients using
    certificates.</p><pre class="screen">

        It is recommended that the Kea DHCPv4 server be started and stopped
        using <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> (described in <a class="xref" href="#keactrl" title="ChapterÂ 6.Â Managing Kea with keactrl">ChapterÂ 6, <i>Managing Kea with keactrl</i></a>).
        However, it is also possible to run the server directly: it accepts
        the following command-line switches:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-c <em class="replaceable"><code>file</code></em></strong></span> -
            specifies the configuration file. This is the only mandatory
            switch.</li><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-d</strong></span> - specifies whether the server
            logging should be switched to debug/verbose mode. In verbose mode,
            the logging severity and debuglevel specified in the configuration
            file are ignored and "debug" severity and the maximum debuglevel
            (99) are assumed. The flag is convenient, for temporarily
            switching the server into maximum verbosity, e.g. when
            debugging.</li><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-p <em class="replaceable"><code>port</code></em></strong></span> -
            specifies UDP port on which the server will listen. This is only
            useful during testing, as a DHCPv4 server listening on
            ports other than the standard ones will not be able to
            handle regular DHCPv4 queries.</li><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-t <em class="replaceable"><code>file</code></em></strong></span> -
            specifies the configuration file to be tested. Kea-dhcp4
            will attempt to load it, and will conduct sanity
            checks. Note that certain checks are possible only while
            running the actual server. The actual status is reported
            with exit code (0 = configuration looks ok, 1 = error
            encountered). Kea will print out log messages to standard
            output and error to standard error when testing
            configuration.</li><li class="listitem">

              additional parameters and exits. The listing includes the versions
              of the libraries dynamically linked to Kea.
            </li><li class="listitem">
              <span class="command"><strong>-W</strong></span> - prints out the Kea configuration report
              and exits. The report is a copy of the

              <strong class="userinput"><code>./configure</code></strong>: it is embedded in the
              executable binary.
            </li></ul></div><p>
        The <code class="filename">config.report</code> may also be accessed more
        directly.  The following command may be used to extract this
        information.  The binary <strong class="userinput"><code>path</code></strong> may be found
        in the install directory or in the <code class="filename">.libs</code>
        subdirectory in the source tree. For example
        <code class="filename">kea/src/bin/dhcp4/.libs/kea-dhcp4</code>.

</p><pre class="screen">
strings <strong class="userinput"><code>path</code></strong>/kea-dhcp4 | sed -n 's/;;;; //p'
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        On start-up, the server will detect available network interfaces
        and will attempt to open UDP sockets on all interfaces
        mentioned in the configuration file.
        Since the DHCPv4 server opens privileged ports, it requires root
        access. Make sure you run this daemon as root.
      </p><p>
        During startup the server will attempt to create a PID file of the
        form: localstatedir]/[conf name].kea-dhcp6.pid where:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>localstatedir</strong></span>: The value as passed into the
            build configure script. It defaults to "/usr/local/var".  (Note
            that this value may be overridden at run time by setting the environment
            variable KEA_PIDFILE_DIR.  This is intended primarily for testing purposes.)
            </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>conf name</strong></span>: The configuration file name
            used to start the server, minus all preceding path and file extension.
            For example, given a pathname of "/usr/local/etc/kea/myconf.txt", the
            portion used would be "myconf".
            </li></ul></div><p>
        If the file already exists and contains the PID of a live process,
        the server will issue a DHCP4_ALREADY_RUNNING log message and exit. It
        is possible, though unlikely, that the file is a remnant of a system crash
        and the process to which the PID belongs is unrelated to Kea.  In such a
        case it would be necessary to manually delete the PID file.
      </p><p>
        The server can be stopped using the <span class="command"><strong>kill</strong></span> command.
        When running in a console, the server can also be shut down by
        pressing ctrl-c. It detects the key combination and shuts
        down gracefully.

        This section explains how to configure the DHCPv4 server using the
        Kea configuration backend. (Kea configuration using any other
        backends is outside of scope of this document.) Before DHCPv4
        is started, its configuration file has to be created. The
        basic configuration is as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
# DHCPv4 configuration starts in this line
"Dhcp4": {

# First we set up global values
    "valid-lifetime": 4000,
    "renew-timer": 1000,
    "rebind-timer": 2000,

# Next we setup the interfaces to be used by the server.
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ "eth0" ]
    },

# And we specify the type of lease database
    "lease-database": {
        "type": "memfile",
        "persist": true,
        "name": "/var/kea/dhcp4.leases"
    },

# Finally, we list the subnets from which we will be leasing addresses.
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            "pools": [
                {
                     "pool": "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
# DHCPv4 configuration ends with the next line
}

} </pre><p>
</p><p>The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the parameters in
the above example together with
their format. Subsequent sections of this chapter go into much greater detail
for these and other parameters.</p><p>The lines starting with a hash (#) are comments and are ignored by
the server; they do not impact its
operation in any way.</p><p>The configuration starts in the first line with the initial
opening curly bracket (or brace). Each configuration consists of
one or more objects. In this specific example, we have only one
object, called Dhcp4. This is a simplified configuration, as usually
there will be additional objects, like <span class="command"><strong>Logging</strong></span> or
<span class="command"><strong>DhcpDdns</strong></span>, but we omit them now for clarity. The Dhcp4
configuration starts with the <span class="command"><strong>"Dhcp4": {</strong></span> line
and ends with the corresponding closing brace (in the above example,
the brace after the last comment).  Everything defined between those
lines is considered to be the Dhcp4 configuration.</p><p>In the general case, the order in which those parameters appear does not
matter. There are two caveats here though. The first one is to remember that
the configuration file must be well formed JSON. That means that the parameters
for any given scope must be separated by a comma and there must not be a comma
after the last parameter. When reordering a configuration file, keep in mind that
moving a parameter to or from the last position in a given scope may also require
moving the comma. The second caveat is that it is uncommon â although
legal JSON â to
repeat the same parameter multiple times. If that happens, the last occurrence of a
given parameter in a given scope is used while all previous instances are
ignored. This is unlikely to cause any confusion as there are no real life
reasons to keep multiple copies of the same parameter in your configuration
file.</p><p>Moving onto the DHCPv4 configuration elements, the first few elements
define some global parameters. <span class="command"><strong>valid-lifetime</strong></span>
defines for how long the addresses (leases) given out by the
server are valid. If nothing changes, a client that got an address is allowed to
use it for 4000 seconds. (Note that integer numbers are specified as is,
without any quotes around them.) <span class="command"><strong>renew-timer</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>rebind-timer</strong></span> are values (also in seconds) that
define T1 and T2 timers that govern when the client will begin the renewal and
rebind procedures. Note that <span class="command"><strong>renew-timer</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>rebind-timer</strong></span> are optional. If they are not specified the
client will select values for T1 and T2 timers according to the
<a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131" target="_top">RFC 2131</a>.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>interfaces-config</strong></span> map specifies the server
configuration concerning the network interfaces, on which the server should
listen to the DHCP messages. The <span class="command"><strong>interfaces</strong></span> parameter
specifies a list of network interfaces on which the server should listen.
Lists are opened and closed with square brackets, with elements separated
by commas. Had we wanted to listen on two interfaces, the
<span class="command"><strong>interfaces-config</strong></span> would look like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
"interfaces-config": {
    "interfaces": [ "eth0", "eth1" ]
},
</pre><p>
</p><p>The next couple of lines define the lease database, the place where the server
stores its lease information. This particular example tells the server to use
<span class="command"><strong>memfile</strong></span>, which is the simplest (and fastest) database
backend. It uses an in-memory database and stores leases on disk in a CSV
file. This is a very simple configuration. Usually the lease database configuration
is more extensive and contains additional parameters.  Note that
<span class="command"><strong>lease-database</strong></span>
is an object and opens up a new scope, using an opening brace.
Its parameters (just one in this example - <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span>)
follow. Had there been more than one, they would be separated by commas. This
scope is closed with a closing brace. As more parameters for the Dhcp4 definition
follow, a trailing comma is present.</p><p>Finally, we need to define a list of IPv4 subnets. This is the
most important DHCPv4 configuration structure as the server uses that
information to process clients' requests. It defines all subnets from
which the server is expected to receive DHCP requests. The subnets are
specified with the <span class="command"><strong>subnet4</strong></span> parameter.  It is a list,
so it starts and ends with square brackets.  Each subnet definition in
the list has several attributes associated with it, so it is a structure
and is opened and closed with braces. At a minimum, a subnet definition
has to have at least two parameters: <span class="command"><strong>subnet</strong></span> (that
defines the whole subnet) and <span class="command"><strong>pools</strong></span> (which is a list of
dynamically allocated pools that are governed by the DHCP server).</p><p>The example contains a single subnet. Had more than one been defined,
additional elements
in the <span class="command"><strong>subnet4</strong></span> parameter would be specified and
separated by commas. For example, to define three subnets, the following
syntax would be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
"subnet4": [
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool":  "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200" } ],
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24"
    },
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.3.100 - 192.0.3.200" } ],
        "subnet": "192.0.3.0/24"

  deployments may elect to store leases in a database. <a class="xref" href="#database-configuration4" title="8.2.2.2.Â Lease Database Configuration">SectionÂ 8.2.2.2, âLease Database Configurationâ</a> describes this option. In typical
  smaller deployments though, the server will store lease information in a CSV file rather
  than a database. As well as requiring less administration, an
  advantage of using a file for storage is that it
  eliminates a dependency on third-party database software.</p><p>The configuration of the file backend (Memfile) is controlled through
  the Dhcp4/lease-database parameters. The <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> parameter
  is mandatory and it specifies which storage for leases the server should use.
  The value of <strong class="userinput"><code>"memfile"</code></strong> indicates that the file should
  be used as the storage. The following list gives additional, optional,
  parameters that can be used to configure the Memfile backend.

  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>persist</strong></span>: controls whether the new leases and
      updates to existing leases are written to the file. It is strongly
      recommended that the value of this parameter is set to
      <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong> at all times, during the server's normal
      operation. Not writing leases to disk will mean that if a server is restarted
      (e.g. after a power failure), it will not know what addresses have been
      assigned.  As a result, it may hand out addresses to new clients that are
      already in use. The value of <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong> is mostly useful
      for performance testing purposes. The default value of the
      <span class="command"><strong>persist</strong></span> parameter is <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>,
      which enables writing lease updates
      to the lease file.
      </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>: specifies an absolute location of the lease
      file in which new leases and lease updates will be recorded. The default value
      for this parameter is <strong class="userinput"><code>"[kea-install-dir]/var/kea/kea-leases4.csv"
      </code></strong>.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span>: specifies the interval in seconds, at
      which the server will perform a lease file cleanup (LFC).  This
      removes redundant (historical) information from the lease file
      and effectively reduces the lease file size. The cleanup process is described
      in more detailed fashion further in this section. The default value of the
      <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> is <strong class="userinput"><code>3600</code></strong>. A value of 0
      disables the LFC.</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>An example configuration of the Memfile backend is presented below:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "lease-database": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"type": "memfile"</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"persist": true</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "/tmp/kea-leases4.csv",</code></strong>
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"lfc-interval": 1800</code></strong>
    }
}
</pre><p>

    This configuration selects the <code class="filename">/tmp/kea-leases4.csv</code> as
    the storage for lease information and enables persistence (writing lease updates
    to this file). It also configures the backend perform the periodic cleanup
    of the lease files, executed every 30 minutes.
  </p><p>It is important to know how the lease file contents are organized
  to understand why the periodic lease file cleanup is needed. Every time
  the server updates a lease or creates a new lease for the client, the new
  lease information must be recorded in the lease file. For performance reasons,
  the server does not update the existing client's lease in the file, as it would
  potentially require rewriting the entire file. Instead, it simply appends the new lease
  information to the end of the file: the previous lease entries for the
  client are not removed. When the server loads leases from the lease file, e.g.
  at the server startup, it assumes that the latest lease entry for the client
  is the valid one. The previous entries are discarded. This means that the
  server can re-construct the accurate information about the leases even though
  there may be many lease entries for each client. However, storing many entries
  for each client results in bloated lease file and impairs the performance of
  the server's startup and reconfiguration as it needs to process a larger number
  of lease entries.
  </p><p>Lease file cleanup (LFC) removes all previous entries for each client and
  leaves only the latest ones. The interval at which the cleanup is performed
  is configurable, and it should be selected according to the frequency of lease
  renewals initiated by the clients. The more frequent the renewals, the smaller
  the value of <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> should be. Note however, that the
  LFC takes time and thus it is possible (although unlikely) that new cleanup
  is started while the previous cleanup instance is still running, if the
  <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> is too short. The server would recover from
  this by skipping the new cleanup when it detects that the previous cleanup
  is still in progress. But it implies that the actual cleanups will be
  triggered more rarely than configured. Moreover, triggering a new cleanup
  adds an overhead to the server which will not be able to respond to new
  requests for a short period of time when the new cleanup process is spawned.
  Therefore, it is recommended that the <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> value
  is selected in a way that would allow for the LFC to complete the cleanup before a
  new cleanup is triggered.
  </p><p>Lease file cleanup is performed by a separate process (in background) to avoid
  a performance impact on the server process. In order to avoid the conflicts
  between two processes both using the same lease files, the LFC process
  operates on the copy of the original lease file, rather than on the lease
  file used by the server to record lease updates. There are also other files
  being created as a side effect of the lease file cleanup. The detailed
  description of the LFC is located on the Kea wiki:
  <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://kea.isc.org/wiki/LFCDesign" target="_top">http://kea.isc.org/wiki/LFCDesign</a></code>.

  parameters. The type of the database must be set to "memfile", "mysql", "postgresql" or
  "cql", e.g.
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"type": "mysql"</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
  Next, the name of the database to hold the leases must be set: this is the
  name used when the database was created
  (see <a class="xref" href="#mysql-database-create" title="4.3.2.1.Â First Time Creation of the MySQL Database">SectionÂ 4.3.2.1, âFirst Time Creation of the MySQL Databaseâ</a>,

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "<em class="replaceable"><code>database-name</code></em>" </code></strong>, ... }, ... }

  For Cassandra:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"keyspace": "<em class="replaceable"><code>database-name</code></em>" </code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
  If the database is located on a different system to the DHCPv4 server, the
  database host name must also be specified. (It should be noted that this
  configuration may have a severe impact on server performance.):
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"host": "<em class="replaceable"><code>remote-host-name</code></em>"</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>

  The usual state of affairs will be to have the database on the same machine as
  the DHCPv4 server.  In this case, set the value to the empty string:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"host" : ""</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>

  Should the database use a port different than default, it may be
  specified as well:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"port" : 12345</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
  Should the database be located on a different system, you may need to specify a longer interval
  for the connection timeout:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"connect-timeout" : <em class="replaceable"><code>timeout-in-seconds</code></em></code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
The default value of five seconds should be more than adequate for local connections.
If a timeout is given though, it should be an integer greater than zero.
  </p><p>
The maxiumum number of times the server will automatically attempt to reconnect to
the lease database after connectivity has been lost may be specified:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"max-reconnect-tries" : <em class="replaceable"><code>number-of-tries</code></em></code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
If the server is unable to reconnect to the database after making the maximum number
of attempts the server will exit. A value of zero (the default) disables automatic
recovery and the server will exit immediately upon detecting a loss of connectivity
(MySQL and Postgres only).
  </p><p>
The number of seconds the server will wait in between attempts to reconnect to the
lease database after connectivity has been lost may also be specified:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"reconnect-wait-time" : <em class="replaceable"><code>number-of-seconds</code></em></code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
A value of zero (the default) disables automatic recovery and the server will exit
immediately upon detecting a loss of connectivity (MySQL and Postgres only).
    </p><p>Finally, the credentials of the account under which the server will
  access the database should be set:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"user": "<em class="replaceable"><code>user-name</code></em>"</code></strong>,

  If there is no password to the account, set the password to the empty string
  "". (This is also the default.)</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="cassandra-database-configuration4"></a>8.2.2.3.Â Cassandra specific parameters</h4></div></div></div><p>
    Cassandra backend is configured slightly differently. Cassandra has a
    concept of contact points that could be used to contact the cluster,
    instead of a single IP or hostname. It takes a list of comma separated IP
    addresses. This may be specified as:
    </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "lease-database": {
        "type": "cql",

        ...
    },
    ...
}</pre><p>
  </p><p>
    Cassandra also supports a number of optional parameters:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <span class="command"><strong>reconnect-wait-time</strong></span> - governs how long Kea waits

      </li><li class="listitem">
        <span class="command"><strong>request-timeout</strong></span> - this parameter sets the timeout for

        algorithm on connections. The default is true.
      </li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    For example, a complex Cassandra configuration with most parameters specified
    could look as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {

Similar parameters can be specified for hosts database.
  </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="hosts4-storage"></a>8.2.3.Â Hosts Storage</h3></div></div></div><p>Kea is also able to store information about host reservations in the
    database. The hosts database configuration uses the same syntax as the lease
    database. In fact, a Kea server opens independent connections for each
    purpose, be it lease or hosts information. This arrangement gives the most
    flexibility. Kea can be used to keep leases and host reservations
    separately, but can also point to the same database. Currently the
    supported hosts database types are MySQL, PostgreSQL and Cassandra.</p><p>Please note that usage of hosts storage is optional. A user can define
    all host reservations in the configuration file. That is the recommended way
    if the number of reservations is small. However, when the number of
    reservations grows it's more convenient to use host storage. Please note
    that both storage methods (configuration file and one of the supported databases)
    can be used together. If hosts are defined in both places, the definitions
    from the configuration file are checked first and external storage is checked
    later, if necessary.</p><p>Version 1.4 extends the host storage to multiple storages. Operations
    are performed on host storages in the configuration order with a special

    always fail.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="hosts-databases-configuration4"></a>8.2.3.1.Â DHCPv4 Hosts Database Configuration</h4></div></div></div><p>Hosts database configuration is controlled through the Dhcp4/hosts-database

In some deployments the database user whose name is specified in the database backend
configuration may not have write privileges to the database. This is often
required by the policy within a given network to secure the data from being
unintentionally modified. In many cases administrators have inventory databases
deployed, which contain substantially more information about the hosts than
static reservations assigned to them. The inventory database can be used to create
a view of a Kea hosts database and such view is often read only.
</p><p>
Kea host database backends operate with an implicit configuration to both
read from and write to the database. If the database user does not have
write access to the host database, the backend will fail to start and the
server will refuse to start (or reconfigure). However, if access to a read
only host database is required for retrieving reservations for clients
and/or assign specific addresses and options, it is possible to explicitly
configure Kea to start in "read-only" mode. This is controlled by the
<span class="command"><strong>readonly</strong></span> boolean parameter as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "hosts-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"readonly": true</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
Setting this parameter to <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong> would configure the
database backend to operate in "read-write" mode, which is also a default
configuration if the parameter is not specified.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The <span class="command"><strong>readonly</strong></span> parameter is currently only supported

  interfaces.  The simplest network interface configuration tells the server to
  listen on all available interfaces:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"*"</code></strong> ]
    }
    ...
},
  </pre><p>
  The asterisk plays the role of a wildcard and means "listen on all interfaces".
  However, it is usually a good idea to explicitly specify interface names:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
  </p><p>It is possible to use wildcard interface name (asterisk) concurrently
  with explicit interface names:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3", "*"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
It is anticipated that this form of usage will only be used when it is desired to
temporarily override a list of interface names and listen on all interfaces.
  </p><p>Some deployments of DHCP servers require that the servers listen
  on the interfaces with multiple IPv4 addresses configured. In these situations,
  the address to use can be selected by appending an IPv4 address to the interface
  name in the following manner:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1/10.0.0.1", "eth3/192.0.2.3"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
  </p><p>Should the server be required to listen on multiple IPv4 addresses assigned
  to the same interface, multiple addresses can be specified for an interface
  as in the example below:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1/10.0.0.1", "eth1/10.0.0.2"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
  </p><p>Alternatively, if the server should listen on all addresses for the particular
  interface, an interface name without any address should be specified.</p><p>Kea supports responding to directly connected clients which don't have
  an address configured. This requires that the server
  injects the hardware address of the destination into the data link layer
  of the packet being sent to the client. The DHCPv4 server utilizes the
  raw sockets to achieve this, and builds the entire IP/UDP stack for the
  outgoing packets. The down side of raw socket use, however, is that incoming
  and outgoing packets bypass the firewalls (e.g. iptables). It is also
  troublesome to handle traffic on multiple IPv4 addresses assigned to the
  same interface, as raw sockets are bound to the interface and advanced
  packet filtering techniques (e.g. using the BPF) have to be used to
  receive unicast traffic on the desired addresses assigned to the interface,
  rather than capturing whole traffic reaching the interface to which the raw
  socket is bound. Therefore, in the deployments where the server doesn't
  have to provision the directly connected clients and only receives the
  unicast packets from the relay agents, the
  DHCP server should be configured to utilize IP/UDP datagram sockets instead of raw sockets.
  The following configuration demonstrates how this can be achieved:

  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3"</code></strong> ],
        "dhcp-socket-type": "udp"
    },
    ...

  The <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span> specifies that the IP/UDP sockets will
  be opened on all interfaces on which the server listens, i.e. "eth1" and
  "eth3" in our case. If the <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span> is set to
  <strong class="userinput"><code>raw</code></strong>, it configures the server to use raw sockets
  instead. If the <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span> value is not specified, the
  default value <strong class="userinput"><code>raw</code></strong> is used.
  </p><p>Using UDP sockets automatically disables the reception of broadcast
  packets from directly connected clients. This effectively means that the
  UDP sockets can be used for relayed traffic only. When using the raw sockets,
  both the traffic from the directly connected clients and the relayed traffic
  will be handled. Caution should be taken when configuring the server to open
  multiple raw sockets on the interface with several IPv4 addresses assigned.
  If the directly connected client sends the message to the broadcast address
  all sockets on this link will receive this message and multiple responses
  will be sent to the client. Hence, the configuration with multiple IPv4
  addresses assigned to the interface should not be used when the directly
  connected clients are operating on that link. To use a single address on
  such interface, the "interface-name/address" notation should be used.
  </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Specifying the value <strong class="userinput"><code>raw</code></strong> as the socket type,
    doesn't guarantee that the raw sockets will be used! The use of raw sockets
    to handle the traffic from the directly connected clients is currently
    supported on Linux and BSD systems only. If the raw sockets are not
    supported on the particular OS, the server will issue a warning and
    fall back to use IP/UDP sockets.</p></div><p>In typical environment the DHCP server is expected to send back a
  response on the same network interface on which the query is received. This is
  the default behavior. However, in some deployments it is desired that the
  outbound (response) packets will be sent as regular traffic and the outbound
  interface will be determined by the routing tables. This kind of asymetric
  traffic is uncommon, but valid. Kea now supports a parameter called
  <span class="command"><strong>outbound-interface</strong></span> that controls this behavior. It supports
  two values. The first one, <strong class="userinput"><code>same-as-inbound</code></strong>, tells Kea
  to send back the response on the same inteface the query packet is received. This
  is the default behavior. The second one, <strong class="userinput"><code>use-routing</code></strong>
  tells Kea to send regular UDP packets and let the kernel's routing table to
  determine most appropriate interface. This only works when
  <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span> is  set to <strong class="userinput"><code>udp</code></strong>.
  An example configuration looks as follows:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ "eth1", "eth3" ],
        "dhcp-socket-type": "udp",
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"outbound-interface": "use-routing"</code></strong>
    },
    ...
}</pre><p>
  </p><p>Interfaces are re-detected at each reconfiguration. This behavior
  can be disabled by setting <span class="command"><strong>re-detect</strong></span> value to
  <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong>, for instance:

  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3"</code></strong> ],
        "re-detect": <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong>
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
  Note interfaces are not re-detected during <span class="command"><strong>config-test</strong></span>.
  </p><p>Usually loopback interfaces (e.g. the "lo" or "lo0" interface)
  may not be configured but if a loopback interface is explicitely configured
  and IP/UDP sockets are specified the loopback interface is accepted.
  </p><p>It can be used for instance to run Kea in a FreeBSD jail having
  only a loopback interface, servicing relayed DHCP request:

  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"lo0"</code></strong> ],

    },
    ...

  where the server receives only relayed traffic; these benefits are
  mentioned in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-interface-configuration" title="8.2.4.Â Interface Configuration">SectionÂ 8.2.4, âInterface Configurationâ</a>. From
  the administrator's perspective it is often desirable to
  configure the system's firewall to filter out the unwanted traffic, and
  the use of UDP sockets facilitates this. However, the administrator must
  also be aware of the implications related to filtering certain types
  of traffic as it may impair the DHCP server's operation.
  </p><p>In this section we are focusing on the case when the server
  receives the DHCPINFORM message from the client via a relay. According
  to <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131" target="_top">RFC 2131</a>,
  the server should unicast the DHCPACK response to the address carried in
  the "ciaddr" field. When the UDP socket is in use, the DHCP server
  relies on the low level functions of an operating system to build the
  data link, IP and UDP layers of the outgoing message. Typically, the
  OS will first use ARP to obtain the client's link layer address to be
  inserted into the frame's header, if the address is not cached from
  a previous transaction that the client had with the server.
  When the ARP exchange is successful, the DHCP message can be unicast
  to the client, using the  obtained address.
  </p><p>Some system administrators block ARP messages in their network,
  which causes issues for the server when it responds to the
  DHCPINFORM messages, because the server is unable to send the
  DHCPACK if the preceding ARP communication fails. Since the OS is
  entirely responsible for the ARP communication and then sending
  the DHCP packet over the wire, the DHCP server has no means to
  determine that the ARP exchange failed and the DHCP response message
  was dropped. Thus, the server does not log any error messages when
  the outgoing DHCP response is dropped. At the same time, all hooks
  pertaining to the packet sending operation will be called, even
  though the message never reaches its destination.
  </p><p>Note that the issue described in this section is not observed
  when the raw sockets are in use, because, in this case, the DHCP server
  builds all the layers of the outgoing message on its own and does not
  use ARP. Instead, it inserts the value carried in the 'chaddr' field
  of the DHCPINFORM message into the link layer.
  </p><p>Server administrators willing to support DHCPINFORM
  messages via relays should not block ARP traffic in their
  networks or should use raw sockets instead of UDP sockets.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ipv4-subnet-id"></a>8.2.6.Â IPv4 Subnet Identifier</h3></div></div></div><p>
    The subnet identifier is a unique number associated with a particular subnet.
    In principle, it is used to associate clients' leases with their respective subnets.
    When a subnet identifier is not specified for a subnet being configured, it will
    be automatically assigned by the configuration mechanism. The identifiers
    are assigned from 1 and are monotonically increased for each subsequent
    subnet: 1, 2, 3 ....
  </p><p>
    If there are multiple subnets configured with auto-generated identifiers and
    one of them is removed, the subnet identifiers may be renumbered. For example:
    if there are four subnets and the third is removed the last subnet will be assigned
    the identifier that the third subnet had before removal. As a result, the leases
    stored in the lease database for subnet 3 are now associated with
    subnet 4, something that may have unexpected consequences. It is planned
    to implement a mechanism to preserve auto-generated subnet ids in a
    future version of Kea.  However, the only remedy for this issue
    at present is to
    manually specify a unique identifier for each subnet.
  </p><p>
        The following configuration will assign the specified subnet
        identifier to the newly configured subnet:

        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"id": 1024</code></strong>,
            ...
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
    This identifier will not change for this subnet unless the "id" parameter is
    removed or set to 0. The value of 0 forces auto-generation of the subnet
    identifier.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp4-address-config"></a>8.2.7.Â Configuration of IPv4 Address Pools</h3></div></div></div><p>
    The main role of a DHCPv4 server is address assignment. For this, the server has to
    be configured with at least one subnet and one pool of dynamic addresses for it to manage.
    For example, assume that the server is connected to a network
    segment that uses the 192.0.2.0/24 prefix. The Administrator of that network
    has decided that addresses from range 192.0.2.10 to 192.0.2.20 are going to
    be managed by the Dhcp4 server. Such a configuration can be achieved in the
    following way:
    </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            "pools": [
                { "pool": "192.0.2.10 - 192.0.2.20" }
            ],
            ...
        }
    ]</code></strong>
}</pre><p>

    Note that <span class="command"><strong>subnet</strong></span> is defined as a simple string, but
    the <span class="command"><strong>pools</strong></span> parameter is actually a list of pools: for
    this reason, the pool definition is enclosed in square brackets, even
    though only one range of addresses is specified.</p><p>Each <span class="command"><strong>pool</strong></span> is a structure that contains the
    parameters that describe a single pool. Currently there is only one
    parameter, <span class="command"><strong>pool</strong></span>, which gives the range of addresses
    in the pool. Additional parameters will be added in future releases of
    Kea.</p><p>It is possible to define more than one pool in a subnet: continuing
    the previous example, further assume that 192.0.2.64/26 should be also be
    managed by the server. It could be written as 192.0.2.64 to
    192.0.2.127. Alternatively, it can be expressed more simply as
    192.0.2.64/26. Both formats are supported by Dhcp4 and can be mixed in the
    pool list.  For example, one could define the following pools:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"pools": [
                { "pool": "192.0.2.10-192.0.2.20" },
                { "pool": "192.0.2.64/26" }
            ]</code></strong>,
            ...
        }
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
    White space in pool definitions is ignored, so spaces before and after the hyphen are optional.
    They can be used to improve readability.
  </p><p>
    The number of pools is not limited, but for performance reasons it is recommended to
    use as few as possible.
  </p><p>
    The server may be configured to serve more than one subnet:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200" } ],
            ...
        },
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.3.0/24",
            "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.3.100 - 192.0.3.200" } ],
            ...
        },
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.4.0/24",
            "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.4.1 - 192.0.4.254" } ],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
  </p><p>
    When configuring a DHCPv4 server using prefix/length notation, please pay
    attention to the boundary values. When specifying that the server can use
    a given pool, it will also be able to allocate the first (typically network
    address) and the last (typically broadcast address) address from that pool.
    In the aforementioned example of pool 192.0.3.0/24, both 192.0.3.0 and
    192.0.3.255 addresses may be assigned as well. This may be invalid in some
    network configurations. If you want to avoid this, please use the "min-max" notation.

        One of the major features of the DHCPv4 server is to provide configuration
        options to clients. Most of the options are sent by the server only if the
        client explicitly requests them using the Parameter Request List option.
        Those that do not require inclusion in the Parameter Request List
        option are commonly used options, e.g. "Domain Server", and options which
        require special behavior, e.g. "Client FQDN" is returned to the client
        if the client has included this option in its message to the server.
      </p><p>
        <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-std-options-list" title="TableÂ 8.1.Â List of standard DHCPv4 options">TableÂ 8.1, âList of standard DHCPv4 optionsâ</a> comprises the list of the

        the options which require special processing and thus cannot be configured
        with some fixed values. The last column of the table indicates which
        options can be sent by the server even when they are not requested in
        the Parameter Request list option, and those which are sent only when
        explicitly requested.

        The following example shows how to configure the addresses of DNS

        Finally, csv-format defaults to true, so it too can be skipped, unless

        It is possible to specify or override options on a per-subnet basis.  If
        clients connected to most of your subnets are expected to get the
        same values of a given option, you should use global options: you
        can then override specific values for a small number of subnets.
        On the other hand, if you use different values in each subnet,
        it does not make sense to specify global option values
        (Dhcp4/option-data), rather you should set only subnet-specific values
        (Dhcp4/subnet[X]/option-data[Y]).

        In some cases it is useful to associate some options with an
        address pool from which a client is assigned a lease. Pool
        specific option values override subnet specific and global
        option values. The server's administrator must not try to
        prioritize assignment of pool specific options by trying to
        order pools declarations in the server configuration. Future
        Kea releases may change the order in which options are
        assigned from the pools without any notice.

        The currently supported standard DHCPv4 options are

        The "Name" and "Code"
        are the values that should be used as a name in the option-data
        structures. "Type" designates the format of the data: the meanings of
        the various types is given in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp-types" title="TableÂ 8.2.Â List of standard DHCP option types">TableÂ 8.2, âList of standard DHCP option typesâ</a>.
      </p><p>When a data field is a string, and that string contains the comma
      (,; U+002C) character, the comma must be escaped with a double reverse solidus
      character (\; U+005C). This double escape is required, because both the
      routine splitting CSV data into fields and JSON use the same escape
      character: a single escape (\,) would make the JSON invalid.
      For example, the string "foo,bar" would be represented as:

        Some options are designated as arrays, which means that more than one
        value is allowed in such an option. For example the option time-servers
        allows the specification of more than one IPv4 address, so allowing
        clients to obtain the addresses of multiple NTP servers.

        The <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-custom-options" title="8.2.9.Â Custom DHCPv4 options">SectionÂ 8.2.9, âCustom DHCPv4 optionsâ</a> describes the configuration
        syntax to create custom option definitions (formats). It is generally not
        allowed to create custom definitions for standard options, even if the
        definition being created matches the actual option format defined in the
        RFCs. There is an exception from this rule for standard options for which
        Kea currently does not provide a definition. In order to use such options,
        a server administrator must create a definition as described in
        <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-custom-options" title="8.2.9.Â Custom DHCPv4 options">SectionÂ 8.2.9, âCustom DHCPv4 optionsâ</a> in the 'dhcp4' option space. This
        definition should match the option format described in the relevant
        RFC but the configuration mechanism will allow any option format as it
        presently has no means to validate it.

      that we want to define a new DHCPv4 option called "foo" which
      will have a code 222 and will convey a single unsigned 32 bit
      integer value. We can define such an option by using the
      following entry in the configuration file:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "foo",
            "code": 222,
            "type": "uint32",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "",
            "space": "dhcp4",
            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }, ...
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span> value of the <span class="command"><strong>array</strong></span>
      parameter determines that the option does NOT comprise an array of
      "uint32" values but is, instead, a single value.  Two other parameters have been
      left blank: <span class="command"><strong>record-types</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span>.  The former specifies the comma separated
      list of option data fields if the option comprises a record of data
      fields. This should be non-empty if the <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> is set to
      "record". Otherwise it must be left blank. The latter parameter specifies
      the name of the option space being encapsulated by the particular
      option. If the particular option does not encapsulate any option space it
      should be left blank.  Note that the above set of comments define the
      format of the new option and do not set its values.
      </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>code</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> parameters are required, all others are
      optional. The <span class="command"><strong>array</strong></span> default value is
      <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span>. The <span class="command"><strong>record-types</strong></span>
      and <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span> default values are blank
      (i.e. ""). The default <span class="command"><strong>space</strong></span> is "dhcp4".
      </p><p>Once the new option format is defined, its value is set
      in the same way as for a standard option. For example the following
      commands set a global value that applies to all subnets.

        }, ...

</pre><p>
      </p><p>New options can take more complex forms than simple use of
      primitives (uint8, string, ipv4-address etc): it is possible to
      define an option comprising a number of existing primitives.
      Assume we want to define a new option that will consist of
      an IPv4 address, followed by an unsigned 16 bit integer, followed by
      a boolean value, followed by a text string. Such an option could
      be defined in the following way:

      The <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> is set to "record" to indicate that the option contains

      This last resort definition for the Vendor Specific Information

      So when there are some known cases where a raw binary value
      will be used, a client class must be defined with a classification

      Currently there are two option spaces defined for the DHCPv4 daemon:
      "dhcp4" (for the top level DHCPv4 options) and
      "vendor-encapsulated-options-space", which is empty by default but
      in which options can be defined. Such options will be carried in the
      Vendor Specific Information option (code 43). The following examples
      show how to define an option "foo" in that space that has a code 1,
      and comprises an
      IPv4 address, an unsigned 16 bit integer and a string. The "foo"
      option is conveyed in a Vendor Specific Information option.
      </p><p>
      The first step is to define the format of the option:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "foo",
            "code": 1,
            "space": "vendor-encapsulated-options-space",
            "type": "record",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "ipv4-address, uint16, string",
            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
     (Note that the option space is set to "vendor-encapsulated-options-space".)
     Once the option format is defined, the next step is to define actual values
     for that option:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "foo",
            "space": "vendor-encapsulated-options-space",
            "code": 1,
            "csv-format": true,
            "data": "192.0.2.3, 123, Hello World"</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
    We also include the Vendor Specific Information option, the option
    that conveys our sub-option "foo". This is required, else the option
    will not be included in messages sent to the client.
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "vendor-encapsulated-options"</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
    Alternatively, the option can be specified using its code.

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"code": 43</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
      </p><p>
      Another possibility, added in Kea 1.3, is to redefine the option,
      see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-private-opts" title="8.2.10.Â DHCPv4 Private Options">SectionÂ 8.2.10, âDHCPv4 Private Optionsâ</a>.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp4-option-spaces"></a>8.2.12.Â Nested DHCPv4 Options (Custom Option Spaces)</h3></div></div></div><p>It is sometimes useful to define a completely new option
      space. This is the case when user creates new option in the
      standard option space ("dhcp4") and wants this option
      to convey sub-options. Since they are in a separate space,
      sub-option codes will have a separate numbering scheme and may
      overlap with the codes of standard options.
      </p><p>Note that creation of a new option space when defining
      sub-options for a standard option is not required, because it is
      created by default if the standard option is meant to convey any
      sub-options (see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-vendor-opts" title="8.2.11.Â DHCPv4 Vendor Specific Options">SectionÂ 8.2.11, âDHCPv4 Vendor Specific Optionsâ</a>).
      </p><p>
      Assume that we want to have a DHCPv4 option called "container" with
      code 222 that conveys two sub-options with codes 1 and 2.
      First we need to define the new sub-options:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "subopt1",
            "code": 1,
            "space": "isc",
            "type": "ipv4-address",
            "record-types": "",
            "array": false,
            "encapsulate": ""
        },
        {
            "name": "subopt2",
            "code": 2,
            "space": "isc",
            "type": "string",
            "record-types": "",
            "array": false,
            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
    Note that we have defined the options to belong to a new option space
    (in this case, "isc").
    </p><p>
    The next step is to define a regular DHCPv4 option with our desired
    code and specify that it should include options from the new option space:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        ...,
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "container",
            "code": 222,
            "space": "dhcp4",
            "type": "empty",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "",
            "encapsulate": "isc"</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
    The name of the option space in which the sub-options are defined
    is set in the <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span> field. The <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> field is set to "empty"
    to indicate that this option does not carry any data other than
    sub-options.
    </p><p>
    Finally, we can set values for the new options:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "subopt1",
            "code": 1,
            "space": "isc",
            "data": "192.0.2.3"</code></strong>
        },
        }
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "subopt2",
            "code": 2,
            "space": "isc",
            "data": "Hello world"</code></strong>
        },
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "container",
            "code": 222,
            "space": "dhcp4"</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
    </p><p>Note that it is possible to create an option which carries some data
    in addition to the sub-options defined in the encapsulated option space.  For example,
    if the "container" option from the previous example was required to carry an uint16
    value as well as the sub-options, the <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> value would have to be set to "uint16" in
    the option definition. (Such an option would then have the following
    data structure: DHCP header, uint16 value, sub-options.) The value specified
    with the <span class="command"><strong>data</strong></span> parameter â which should be a valid integer enclosed in quotes,
    e.g. "123" â would then be assigned to the uint16 field in the "container" option.

      an option configuration and the default values may be used. However, it is
      important to understand the implications of not specifying some of them
      as it may result in configuration errors. The list below explains
      the behavior of the server when a particular parameter is not explicitly
      specified:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> - the server requires an option name or
          option code to identify an option. If this parameter is unspecified, the
          option code must be specified.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>code</strong></span> - the server requires an option name or
          option code to identify an option. This parameter may be left unspecified if
          the <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> parameter is specified. However, this also
          requires that the particular option has its definition (it is either a
          standard option or an administrator created a definition for the option
          using an 'option-def' structure), as the option definition associates an
          option with a particular name. It is possible to configure an option
          for which there is no definition (unspecified option format).
          Configuration of such options requires the use of option code.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>space</strong></span> - if the option space is unspecified it
          will default to 'dhcp4' which is an option space holding DHCPv4 standard
          options.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>data</strong></span> - if the option data is unspecified it
          defaults to an empty value. The empty value is mostly used for the
          options which have no payload (boolean options), but it is legal to specify
          empty values for some options which carry variable length data and which
          the specification allows for the length of 0. For such options, the data parameter
          may be omitted in the configuration.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>csv-format</strong></span> - if this value is not
          specified the server will assume that the option data is specified as
          a list of comma separated values to be assigned to individual fields
          of the DHCP option. This behavior has changed in Kea 1.2. Older
          versions used additional logic to determine whether the csv-format
          should be true or false. That is no longer the case.

      contacts the server to obtain other configuration parameters, e.g. addresses of DNS servers.
      In order to obtain the stateless configuration parameters the client sends the
      DHCPINFORM message to the server with the "ciaddr" set to the address that the

      The DHCPv4 server includes support for client classification.  For a deeper
      discussion of the classification process see <a class="xref" href="#classify" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Client Classification">ChapterÂ 13, <i>Client Classification</i></a>.
      </p><p>
      In certain cases it is useful to differentiate between different types of
      clients and treat them accordingly. It is envisaged that client
      classification will be used for changing the behavior of almost any part of
      the DHCP message processing. In the current release of the software however,
      there are  only some mechanisms that take advantage of client classification:
      private options and option 43 deferred unpacking, subnet selection,
      pool selection, assignment of different options, and, for cable modems, there
      are specific options for use with the TFTP server address and the boot file field.
      </p><p>
      Kea can be instructed to limit access to given subnets based on class information.
      This is particularly useful for cases where two types of devices share the
      same link and are expected to be served from two different subnets. The
      primary use case for such a scenario is cable networks. Here, there are two
      classes of devices: the cable modem itself, which should be handed a lease
      from subnet A and all other devices behind the modem that should get a lease
      from subnet B. That segregation is essential to prevent overly curious
      users from playing with their cable modems. For details on how to set up
      class restrictions on subnets, see <a class="xref" href="#classification-subnets" title="13.6.Â Configuring Subnets With Class Information">SectionÂ 13.6, âConfiguring Subnets With Class Informationâ</a>.
      </p><p>
      When subnets belong to a shared network the classification applies
      to subnet selection but not to pools, e.g., a pool in a subnet
      limited to a particular class can still be used by clients which do not
      belong to the class if the pool they are expected to use is exhausted.
      So the limit access based on class information is also available
      at the pool level, see <a class="xref" href="#classification-pools" title="13.7.Â Configuring Pools With Class Information">SectionÂ 13.7, âConfiguring Pools With Class Informationâ</a>,
      within a subnet.
      This is useful when to segregate clients belonging to the same subnet
      into different address ranges.
      </p><p>
      The process of doing classification is conducted in several steps. The first step
      is to assess an incoming packet and assign it to zero or more classes.  The
      second step is to choose a subnet, possibly based on the class information.
      The third step is to assign classes from host reservations and
      evaluate class expressions depending on the "KNOWN" class.
      After the list of required classes is built and each class of the list
      has its expression evaluated: when it returns true the packet is added
      as a member of the class.
      The last step is to assign options, again possibly based on the class
      information.
      More complete and detailed description is available in
      <a class="xref" href="#classify" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Client Classification">ChapterÂ 13, <i>Client Classification</i></a>.
      </p><p>
      There are two main methods of doing classification. The first is automatic and relies
      on examining the values in the vendor class options or existence of a
      host reservation. Information from these
      options is extracted and a class name is constructed from it and added to
      the class list for the packet. The second allows for specifying an expression
      that is evaluated for each packet. If the result is true the packet is
      a member of the class.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        Care should be taken with client classification as it is easy for
        clients that do not meet class criteria to be denied any service altogether.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp56743056"></a>8.2.15.1.Â Setting Fixed Fields in Classification</h4></div></div></div><p>
          It is possible to specify that clients belonging to a particular class
          should receive packets with specific values in certain fixed fields.
          In particular, three fixed fields are supported:
          <span class="command"><strong>next-server</strong></span> (that conveys an IPv4 address, which is
          set in the siaddr field), <span class="command"><strong>server-hostname</strong></span> (that
          conveys a server hostname, can be up to 64 bytes long and will be sent
          in the sname field) and <span class="command"><strong>boot-file-name</strong></span> (that
          conveys the configuration file, can be up to 128 bytes long and will
          be sent using file field).
        </p><p>
          Obviously, there are many ways to assign clients to specific classes,
          but for the PXE clients the client architecture type option (code 93)
          seems to be particularly suited to
          make the distinction. The following example checks if the client
          identifies itself as PXE device with architecture EFI x86-64, and
          sets several fields if it does. See
          <a class="ulink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4578#section-2.1" target="_top">Section 2.1 of RFC 4578</a>)
          or the documentation of your client for specific values.

        The server checks whether an incoming packet includes the vendor class identifier
        option (60). If it does, the content of that option is prepended with
        "VENDOR_CLASS_", it is interpreted as a class. For example,
        modern cable modems will send this option with value "docsis3.0"
        and as a result the packet will belong to class "VENDOR_CLASS_docsis3.0".

          Kea 1.0 and earlier versions performed special actions for

        In some cases it is useful to limit the scope of a class to
        a shared-network, subnet or pool. There are two parameters
        which are used to limit the scope of the class by instructing
        the server to perform evaluation of test expressions when
        required.
        </p><p>
        The first one is the per-class <span class="command"><strong>only-if-required</strong></span>
        flag which is false by default. When it is set to
        <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> the test expression of the class is not
        evaluated at the reception of the incoming packet but later and
        only if the class evaluation is required.
        </p><p>
        The second is the <span class="command"><strong>require-client-classes</strong></span> which
        takes a list of class names and is valid in shared-network,
        subnet and pool scope. Classes in these lists are marked as
        required and evaluated after selection of this specific
        shared-network/subnet/pool and before output option processing.
        </p><p>
        In this example, a class is assigned to the incoming packet
        when the specified subnet is used.

        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "client-classes": [

         </p><p>
         Required evaluation can be used to express complex dependencies,
         for example, subnet membership. It can also be used to reverse the
         precedence: if you set an option-data in a subnet it takes
         precedence over an option-data in a class. When you move the
         option-data to a required class and require it in
         the subnet, a class evaluated earlier may take precedence.
         </p><p>
         Required evaluation is also available at shared-network and
         pool levels. The order in which required classes are considered is:
         shared-network, subnet and pool, i.e. the opposite order
         option-data are processed.

      As mentioned earlier, kea-dhcp4 can be configured to generate requests to the
      DHCP-DDNS server (referred to here as "D2" ) to update DNS entries.  These requests are known as

      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
      Whether it is a request to add (update) or remove DNS entries
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

      The parameters for controlling the generation of NCRs for submission to D2
      are contained in the <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-ddns</strong></span> section of the kea-dhcp4 server
      configuration. The mandatory parameters for the DHCP DDNS configuration
      are <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span> which is unconditionally

      In general, kea-dhcp4 will generate DDNS update requests when:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
      A new lease is granted in response to a DHCP REQUEST
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      An existing lease is renewed but the FQDN associated with it has
      changed.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      An existing lease is released in response to a DHCP RELEASE
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      In the second case, lease renewal, two  DDNS requests will be issued: one
      request to remove entries for the previous FQDN and a second request to
      add entries for the new FQDN.  In the last case, a lease release, a
      single DDNS request to remove its entries will be made.
      </p><p>
      The decision making involved when granting a new lease (the first case) is more
      involved.  When a new lease is granted, kea-dhcp4 will generate a DDNS
      update request if the DHCP REQUEST contains either the FQDN option
      (code 81) or the Host Name option (code 12). If both are present,
      the server will use the FQDN option. By default kea-dhcp4
      will respect the FQDN N and S flags specified by the client as shown
      in the following table:
      </p><div class="table"><a name="fqdn-flag-table"></a><p class="title"><b>TableÂ 8.3.Â Default FQDN Flag Behavior</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Default FQDN Flag Behavior" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left" class="cflags"><col align="left" class="meaning"><col align="left" class="response"><col align="left" class="sflags"></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Client Flags:N-S</th><th align="left">Client Intent</th><th align="left">Server Response</th><th align="left">Server Flags:N-S-O</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">0-0</td><td align="left">

      The first row in the table above represents "client delegation". Here
      the DHCP client states that it intends to do the forward DNS updates and
      the server should do the reverse updates.  By default, kea-dhcp4 will honor
      the client's wishes and generate a DDNS request to the D2 server to update only
      reverse DNS data.  The parameter <span class="command"><strong>override-client-update</strong></span> can be used
      to instruct the server to override client delegation requests.  When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp4 will disregard requests for client
      delegation and generate a DDNS request to update both forward and
      reverse DNS data.  In this case, the N-S-O flags in the server's
      response to the client will be 0-1-1 respectively.
      </p><p>
      (Note that the flag combination N=1, S=1 is prohibited according to
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4702" target="_top">RFC 4702</a>. If such a
      combination is received from the client, the packet will be dropped by kea-dhcp4.)
      </p><p>
      To override client delegation, set the following values in the configuration file:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"override-client-update": true</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The third row in the table above describes the case in which the client
      requests that no DNS updates be done. The parameter, <span class="command"><strong>override-no-update</strong></span>,
      can be used to instruct the server to disregard the client's wishes. When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp4 will generate DDNS update requests to kea-dhcp-ddns
      even if the client requests that no updates be done.  The N-S-O flags in the
      server's response to the client will be 0-1-1.
      </p><p>
      To override client delegation, the following values should be set in your configuration:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"override-no-update": true</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      kea-dhcp4 will always generate DDNS update requests if the client request
      only contains the Host Name option. In addition it will include an FQDN
      option in the response to the client with the FQDN N-S-O flags set to
      0-1-0 respectively. The domain name portion of the FQDN option will be
      the name submitted to D2 in the DDNS update request.

      name whose DNS entries are to be affected.  kea-dhcp4 can be configured to
      supply a portion or all of that name based upon what it receives from
      the client in the DHCP REQUEST.</p><p>
       The default rules for constructing the FQDN that will be used for DNS
       entries are:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
        If the DHCPREQUEST contains the client FQDN option, the candidate name
        is taken from there, otherwise it is taken from the Host Name option.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        If the candidate name is a partial (i.e. unqualified) name then add a
        configurable suffix to the name and use the result as the FQDN.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        If the candidate name provided is empty, generate a FQDN using a
        configurable prefix and suffix.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        If the client provided neither option, then no DNS action will be taken.
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
        These rules can amended by setting the
        <span class="command"><strong>replace-client-name</strong></span> parameter which provides the
        following modes of behavior:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>never</strong></span> - Use the name the client sent.  If the client
        sent no name, do not generate one.  This is the default mode.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>always</strong></span> - Replace the name the client sent. If the
        client sent no name, generate one for the client.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>when-present</strong></span> - Replace the name the client sent.
        If the client sent no name, do not generate one.

        <span class="command"><strong>when-not-present</strong></span> - Use the name the client sent.
        If the client sent no name, generate one for the client.

      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
    Note that formerly, this parameter was a boolean and permitted only values
    of <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span>.  Boolean values
    have been deprecated and are no longer accepted.  If you are currently using
    booleans, you must replace them with the desired mode name. A value of
    <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> maps to <span class="command"><strong>"when-present"</strong></span>, while
    <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span> maps to <span class="command"><strong>"never"</strong></span>.
        </p></div><p>

      For example, To instruct kea-dhcp4 to always generate the FQDN for a
      client, set the parameter <span class="command"><strong>replace-client-name</strong></span> to
      <span class="command"><strong>always</strong></span> as follows:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"replace-client-name": "always"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The prefix used in the generation of a FQDN is specified by the
      <span class="command"><strong>generated-prefix</strong></span> parameter.  The default value is "myhost".  To alter
      its value, simply set it to the desired string:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"generated-prefix": "another.host"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The suffix used when generating a FQDN or when qualifying a
      partial name is specified by
      the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> parameter. This
      parameter has no default value, thus it is mandatory when
      DDNS updates are enabled.
      To set its value simply set it to the desired string:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"qualifying-suffix": "foo.example.org"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      When generating a name, kea-dhcp4 will construct name of the format:
      </p><p>
        [generated-prefix]-[address-text].[qualifying-suffix].
      </p><p>
      where address-text is simply the lease IP address converted to a
      hyphenated string.  For example, if the lease address is 172.16.1.10,
      the qualifying suffix "example.com", and the default value is used for
      <span class="command"><strong>generated-prefix</strong></span>, the generated FQDN would be:
      </p><p>
        myhost-172-16-1-10.example.com.

      Although there is a dedicated option for it, some devices may use the siaddr field
      in the DHCPv4 packet for that purpose. That specific field can be configured
      using <span class="command"><strong>next-server</strong></span> directive. It is possible to define it in the global scope or
      for a given subnet only. If both are defined, the subnet value takes precedence.
      The value in subnet can be set to 0.0.0.0, which means that <span class="command"><strong>next-server</strong></span> should
      not be sent. It may also be set to an empty string, which means the same as if
      it was not defined at all, i.e. use the global value.

      server must not send back client-id options when responding to
      clients. However, in some cases that confused clients that did
      not have MAC address or client-id; see
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6842" target="_top">RFC 6842</a>.

      other clients) from which it receives the message. There are many reasons
      why this identification is required and the most important ones are:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">When the client contacts the server to allocate a new
        lease, the server must store the client identification information in
        the lease database as a search key.</li><li class="listitem">When the client is trying to renew or release the existing
        lease, the server must be able to find the existing lease entry in the
        database for this client, using the client identification information as a
        search key.</li><li class="listitem">Some configurations use static reservations for the IP
        addresses and other configuration information. The server's administrator
        uses client identification information to create these static assignments.
        </li><li class="listitem">In the dual stack networks there is often a need to
        correlate the lease information stored in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 server for
        a particular host. Using common identification information by the DHCPv4
        and DHCPv6 client allows the network administrator to achieve this
        correlation and better administer the network.</li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>DHCPv4 makes use of two distinct identifiers which are placed
      by the client in the queries sent to the server and copied by the server
      to its responses to the client: "chaddr" and "client identifier". The
      former was introduced as a part of the BOOTP specification and it is also
      used by DHCP to carry the hardware address of the interface used to send
      the query to the server (MAC address for the Ethernet). The latter is
      carried in the Client-identifier option, introduced in
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132" target="_top">RFC 2132</a>.
      </p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131" target="_top">RFC 2131</a>
      indicates that the server may use both of these identifiers to identify
      the client but the "client identifier", if present, takes precedence
      over "chaddr". One of the reasons for this is that "client identifier"
      is independent from the hardware used by the client to communicate with
      the server. For example, if the client obtained the lease using one
      network card and then the network card is moved to another host, the
      server will wrongly identify this host is the one which has obtained
      the lease. Moreover,
      <a class="ulink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4361" target="_top">RFC 4361</a> gives
      the recommendation to use a DUID
      (see <a class="ulink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315" target="_top">RFC 3315</a>,
      the DHCPv6 specification)
      carried as "client identifier" when dual stack networks are in use
      to provide consistent identification information of the client, regardless
      of the protocol type it is using. Kea adheres to these specifications and
      the "client identifier" by default takes precedence over the value carried
      in "chaddr" field when the server searches, creates, updates or removes
      the client's lease.
      </p><p>When the server receives a DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST message from the
      client, it will try to find out if the client already has a lease in the
      database and will hand out that lease rather than allocate
      a new one. Each lease in the lease database is associated with the
      "client identifier" and/or "chaddr". The server will first use the
      "client identifier" (if present) to search the lease. If the lease is
      found, the server will treat this lease as belonging to the client
      even if the current "chaddr" and the "chaddr" associated with
      the lease do not match. This facilitates the scenario when the network card
      on the client system has been replaced and thus the new MAC address
      appears in the messages sent by the DHCP client. If the server fails
      to find the lease using the "client identifier" it will perform another lookup
      using the "chaddr". If this lookup returns no result, the client is
      considered as not having a lease and the new lease will be created.
      </p><p>A common problem reported by network operators is that poor
      client implementations do not use stable client identifiers, instead
      generating a new "client identifier" each time the client connects
      to the network. Another well known case is when the client changes its
      "client identifier" during the multi-stage boot process (PXE). In such
      cases, the MAC address of the client's interface remains stable and
      using "chaddr" field to identify the client guarantees that the
      particular system is considered to be the same client, even though its
      "client identifier" changes.
      </p><p>To address this problem, Kea includes a configuration option
      which enables client identification using "chaddr" only by instructing
      the server to disregard server to "ignore" the "client identifier" during
      lease lookups and allocations for a particular subnet. Consider the following
      simplified server configuration:</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    ...
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"match-client-id": true,</code></strong>
    ...
    "subnet4": [
    {
        "subnet": "192.0.10.0/24",
        "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.2.23-192.0.2.87" } ],
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"match-client-id": false</code></strong>
    },
    {
        "subnet": "10.0.0.0/8",
        "pools": [ { "pool": "10.0.0.23-10.0.2.99" } ],
    }
    ]
}
</pre><p>The <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> is a boolean value which
     controls this behavior. The default value of <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>
     indicates that the server will use the "client identifier" for lease
     lookups and "chaddr" if the first lookup returns no results. The
     <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span> means that the server will only
     use the "chaddr" to search for client's lease. Whether the DHCID for
     DNS updates is generated from the "client identifier" or "chaddr" is
     controlled through the same parameter accordingly.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> parameter may appear
     both in the global configuration scope and/or under any subnet
     declaration. In the example shown above, the effective value of the
     <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> will be <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong>
     for the subnet 192.0.10.0/24, because the subnet specific setting
     of the parameter overrides the global value of the parameter. The
     effective value of the <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> for the subnet
     10.0.0.0/8 will be set to <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong> because the
     subnet declaration lacks this parameter and the global setting is
     by default used for this subnet. In fact, the global entry for this
     parameter could be omitted in this case, because
     <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong> is the default value.
     </p><p>It is important to explain what happens when the client obtains
     its lease for one setting of the <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span>
     and then renews when the setting has been changed. First consider
     the case when the client obtains the lease when the
     <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> is set to <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>.
     The server will store the lease information including "client identifier"
     (if supplied) and "chaddr" in the lease database. When the setting is
     changed and the client renews the lease the server will determine that
     it should use the "chaddr" to search for the existing lease. If the
     client hasn't changed its MAC address the server should successfully
     find the existing lease. The "client identifier" associated with the
     returned lease is ignored and the client is allowed to use this lease.
     When the lease is renewed only the "chaddr" is recorded for this
     lease according to the new server setting.
     </p><p>In the second case the client has the lease with only a "chaddr"
     value recorded. When the setting is changed to
     <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> set to <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>
     the server will first try to use the "client identifier" to find the
     existing client's lease. This will return no results because the
     "client identifier" was not recorded for this lease. The server will
     then use the "chaddr" and the lease will be found. If the lease appears
     to have no "client identifier" recorded, the server will assume that
     this lease belongs to the client and that it was created with the previous
     setting of the <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span>.
     However, if the lease contains "client identifier" which is different
     from the "client identifier" used by the client the lease will be
     assumed to belong to another client and the new lease will be
     allocated.

        of Kea. For instance the support of port relay (RFC 8357) introduced
        such incompatible change.</p></div><p>
      The <span class="command"><strong>dhcp4o6-port</strong></span> global parameter specifies
      the first of the two consecutive ports of the UDP sockets used
      for the communication between the DHCPv6 and DHCPv4 servers
      (the DHCPv4 server is bound to ::1 on <span class="command"><strong>port</strong></span> + 1
      and connected to ::1 on <span class="command"><strong>port</strong></span>).
      </p><p>
      With DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 the DHCPv4 server does not have access
      to several of the identifiers it would normally use to select a
      subnet.  In order to address this issue three new configuration
      entries have been added.  The presence of any of these allows the
      subnet to be used with DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6.  These entries are:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>4o6-subnet</strong></span>: Takes a prefix (i.e., an

    a per host basis. The most obvious one is to reserve a specific, static
    address for exclusive use by a given client (host) â the returning client will
    receive the same address from the server every time, and other clients will
    generally not receive that address.
    Another example when the host reservations are applicable is when a host
    has specific requirements, e.g. a printer that needs additional DHCP options.
    Yet another possible use case is to define unique names for hosts.</p><p>Note that there may be cases when the
    new reservation has been made for the client for the address being currently
    in use by another client. We call this situation a "conflict". The conflicts
    get resolved automatically over time as described in subsequent sections.
    Once the conflict is resolved, the client will keep receiving the reserved
    configuration when it renews.</p><p>Host reservations are defined as parameters for each subnet. Each host
    has to be identified by an identifier, for example the hardware/MAC address. There is an optional
    <span class="command"><strong>reservations</strong></span> array in the <span class="command"><strong>Subnet4</strong></span>
    element. Each element in that array is a structure that holds information
    about reservations for a single host. In particular, the structure has
    to have an identifier that uniquely identifies a host.  In the DHCPv4 context, the
    identifier is usually a hardware or MAC address.  In most cases an IP address
    will be specified. It is also possible to specify a hostname, host
    specific options or fields carried within DHCPv4 message such as siaddr,
    sname or file.</p><p>In Kea 1.0.0 it was only possible to create host reservations
    using client's hardware address. Host reservations by client
    identifier, DUID and circuit-id have been added in Kea 1.1.0.</p><p>The following example shows how to reserve addresses for specific
    hosts:

    The first entry reserves the 192.0.2.202 address for the client that uses
    a MAC address of 1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f. The second entry reserves the address
    192.0.2.100 and the hostname of alice-laptop for the client using a DUID
    0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f. (Note that if you plan to do DNS updates, it
    is strongly recommended for the hostnames to be unique.) The third
    example reserves address 192.0.3.203 to a client whose request
    would be relayed by a relay agent that inserts a circuit-it option
    with the value 'charter950'. The fourth entry reserves address
    192.0.2.204 for a client that uses a client identifier with value
    01:11:22:33:44:55:66.</p><p>The above example is used for illustrational purposes only
    and in actual deployments it is recommended to use as few types as possible
    (preferably just one). See <a class="xref" href="#reservations4-tuning" title="8.3.8.Â Fine Tuning DHCPv4 Host Reservation">SectionÂ 8.3.8, âFine Tuning DHCPv4 Host Reservationâ</a> for a detailed
    discussion of this point.</p><p>Making a reservation for a mobile host that may visit multiple subnets
    requires a separate host definition in each subnet it is expected to visit.
    It is not allowed to define multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address in a single subnet. Multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address are valid if each is in a different subnet.
    </p><p>Adding host reservation incurs a performance penalty. In principle,
    when a server that does not support host reservation responds to a query,
    it needs to check whether there is a lease for a given address being
    considered for allocation or renewal. The server that also supports host
    reservation has to perform additional checks: not only if the address is
    currently used (i.e. if there is a lease for it), but also whether the address
    could be used by someone else (i.e. there is a reservation for it). That
    additional check incurs additional overhead.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation4-types"></a>8.3.1.Â Address Reservation Types</h3></div></div></div><p>In a typical scenario there is an IPv4 subnet defined,
      e.g. 192.0.2.0/24, with certain part of it dedicated for dynamic allocation
      by the DHCPv4 server. That dynamic part is referred to as a dynamic pool or
      simply a pool. In principle, a host reservation can reserve any address
      that belongs to the subnet. The reservations that specify addresses that
      belong to configured pools are called "in-pool reservations".
      In contrast, those that do not belong to dynamic pools are called
      "out-of-pool reservations". There is no formal difference
      in the reservation syntax and both reservation types are
      handled uniformly. However, upcoming releases may offer improved performance
      if there are only out-of-pool reservations as the server will be able
      to skip reservation checks when dealing with existing leases. Therefore,
      system administrators are encouraged to use out-of-pool reservations if
      possible.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation4-conflict"></a>8.3.2.Â Conflicts in DHCPv4 Reservations</h3></div></div></div><p>As the reservations and lease information are stored separately,
      conflicts may arise. Consider the following series of events. The server
      has configured the dynamic pool of addresses from the range of 192.0.2.10 to
      192.0.2.20. Host A requests an address and gets 192.0.2.10. Now the system
      administrator decides to reserve address 192.0.2.10 for Host B.
      In general, reserving an address that
      is currently assigned to someone else is not recommended, but there are
      valid use cases where such an operation is warranted.</p><p>The server now has a conflict to resolve. Let's analyze the
      situation here. If Host B boots up and requests an address, the server is
      not able to assign the reserved address 192.0.2.10. A naive approach
      would to be immediately remove the existing lease for the Host A
      and create a new one for the Host B. That would not solve the problem,
      though, because as soon as the Host B gets the address, it will detect
      that the address is already in use by the Host A and would send
      the DHCPDECLINE message. Therefore, in this situation, the server has
      to temporarily assign a different address (not matching what has been
      reserved) to the Host B.</p><p>When Host A renews its address, the server will discover that
      the address being renewed is now reserved for another host - Host
      B. Therefore the server will inform the Host A that it is no longer
      allowed to use it by sending a DHCPNAK message. The server will not remove the
      lease, though, as there's small chance that the DHCPNAK may be lost if the
      network is lossy. If that happens, the client will not receive any
      responses, so it will retransmit its DHCPREQUEST packet. Once the
      DHCPNAK is received by Host A, it will revert to the server
      discovery and will eventually get a different address. Besides
      allocating a new lease, the server will also remove the old one. As
      a result, address 192.0.2.10 will become free . When Host B
      tries to renew its temporarily assigned address, the server will detect
      that it has a valid lease, but there is a reservation for a different
      address. The server will send DHCPNAK to inform Host B that its address
      is no longer usable, but will keep its lease (again, the DHCPNAK may be
      lost, so the server will keep it, until the client returns for a new
      address). Host B will revert to the server discovery phase and will
      eventually send a DHCPREQUEST message. This time the server will find
      out that there is a reservation for that host and the reserved address
      192.0.2.10 is not used, so it will be granted. It will also remove the
      lease for the temporarily assigned address that Host B previously
      obtained.</p><p>This recovery will succeed, even if other hosts will attempt to get
      the reserved address. Had the Host C requested address 192.0.2.10 after
      the reservation was made, the server will either offer a different
      address (when responding to DHCPDISCOVER) or would send DHCPNAK
      (when responding to DHCPREQUEST).</p><p>This recovery mechanism allows the server to fully recover from a
      case where reservations conflict with the existing leases. This procedure
      takes time and will roughly take as long as the value set for of renew-timer.
      The best way to avoid such recovery is to not define new reservations that
      conflict with existing leases. Another recommendation is to use
      out-of-pool reservations. If the reserved address does not belong to a
      pool, there is no way that other clients could get this address.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation4-hostname"></a>8.3.3.Â Reserving a Hostname</h3></div></div></div><p>When the reservation for a client includes the <span class="command"><strong>hostname</strong></span>,
      the server will return this hostname to the client in
      the Client FQDN or Hostname options. The server responds with the Client
      FQDN option only if the client has included Client FQDN option in its
      message to the server. The server will respond with the Hostname option
      if the client included Hostname option in its message to the server
      or when the client requested Hostname option using Parameter Request
      List option. The server will return the Hostname option even if it is not
      configured to perform DNS updates. The reserved hostname always takes
      precedence over the hostname supplied by the client or the autogenerated
      (from the IPv4 address) hostname.</p><p>The server qualifies the reserved hostname with the value
      of the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> parameter. For example, the
      following subnet configuration:
</p><pre class="screen">
    {
        "subnet4": [ {
            "subnet": "10.0.0.0/24",

            "qualifying-suffix": "example.isc.org."

    }
</pre><p>
      will result in assigning the "alice-laptop.example.isc.org." hostname to the
      client using the MAC address "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff". If the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix
      </strong></span> is not specified, the default (empty) value will be used, and
      in this case the value specified as a <span class="command"><strong>hostname</strong></span> will
      be treated as fully qualified name. Thus, by leaving the
      <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> empty it is possible to qualify
      hostnames for the different clients with different domain names:

      allocation engine (the component of Kea that selects an address for a client)
      during lease selection and renewal. In particular, three
      major checks are necessary. First, when selecting a new lease, it is not
      sufficient for a candidate lease to not be used by another DHCP client. It
      also must not be reserved for another client. Second, when renewing a lease,
      additional check must be performed whether the address being renewed is not
      reserved for another client. Finally, when a host renews an address, the server
      has to check whether there is a reservation for this host, so the existing
      (dynamically allocated) address should be revoked and the reserved one be
      used instead.
      </p><p>Some of those checks may be unnecessary in certain deployments and not
      performing them may improve performance. The Kea server provides the
      <span class="command"><strong>reservation-mode</strong></span> configuration parameter to select the
      types of reservations allowed for the particular subnet. Each reservation
      type has different constraints for the checks to be performed by the
      server when allocating or renewing a lease for the client.
      Allowed values are:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"> <span class="command"><strong>all</strong></span> - enables all host reservation
      types. This is the default value. This setting is the safest and the most
      flexible. It allows in-pool and out-of-pool reservations. As all checks
      are conducted, it is also the slowest.
      </li><li class="listitem"> <span class="command"><strong>out-of-pool</strong></span> - allows only out of
      pool host reservations.  With this setting in place, the server may assume
      that all host reservations are for addresses that do not belong to the
      dynamic pool. Therefore it can skip the reservation checks when dealing
      with in-pool addresses, thus improving performance. Do not use this mode
      if any of your reservations use in-pool address. Caution is advised when
      using this setting: Kea does not sanity check the reservations against
      <span class="command"><strong>reservation-mode</strong></span> and misconfiguration may cause problems.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>disabled</strong></span> - host reservation support is disabled. As there
      are no reservations, the server will skip all checks. Any reservations defined
      will be completely ignored. As the checks are skipped, the server may
      operate faster in this mode.
      </li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
        An example configuration that disables reservation looks like follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
    {
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"reservation-mode": "disabled"</code></strong>,
        ...
    }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
      </p><p>Another aspect of the host reservations are the different types of
      identifiers. Kea 1.1.0 supports four types of identifiers
      (hw-address, duid, client-id and circuit-id), but more identifier types
      are likely to be added in the future. This is beneficial from a
      usability perspective. However, there is a drawback. For each incoming
      packet Kea has to to extract each identifier type and then query the
      database to see if there is a reservation done by this particular
      identifier. If nothing is found, the next identifier is extracted and the next
      query is issued. This process continues until either a reservation is
      found or all identifier types have been checked. Over time with an increasing
      number of supported identifier types, Kea would become slower and
      slower.</p><p>To address this problem, a parameter called
      <span class="command"><strong>host-reservation-identifiers</strong></span> has been introduced. It
      takes a list of identifier types as a parameter. Kea will check only those
      identifier types enumerated in host-reservation-identifiers. From a
      performance perspective the number of identifier types should be kept to a
      minimum, ideally limited to one. If your deployment uses several
      reservation types, please enumerate them from most to least frequently
      used as this increases the chances of Kea finding the reservation using the
      fewest number of queries. An example of host reservation identifiers looks
      as follows:

</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>"host-reservation-identifiers": [ "circuit-id", "hw-address", "duid", "client-id" ],</code></strong>
"subnet4": [
    {
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
        ...
    }
]</pre><p>
</p><p>
If not specified, the default value is:
</p><pre class="screen">

</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="shared-network4"></a>8.4.Â Shared networks in DHCPv4</h2></div></div></div><p>DHCP servers use subnet information in two ways. First, it is used
    to determine the point of attachment, or simply put, where the client is
    connected to the network. Second, the subnet information is used to group
    information pertaining to specific location in the network. This approach
    works well in general case, but the are scenarios where the boundaries are
    blurred. Sometimes it is useful to have more than one logical IP subnet
    being deployed on the same physical link. The need to understand
    that two or more subnets are used on the same link requires additional logic
    in the DHCP server. This capability has been added in Kea 1.3.0. It is
    called "shared networks" in Kea and ISC DHCP projects. It is sometimes also
    called "shared subnets". In Microsoft's nomenclature it is called "multinet".
    </p><p>There are many use cases where the feature is useful. This paragraph
    explains just a handful of the most common ones. The first and by far the most
    common use case is an existing network that has grown and is running out of
    available address space. Rather than migrating all devices to a new, larger
    subnet, it is easier to simply configure additional subnet on top of the
    existing one. Sometimes, due to address space fragmentation (e.g. only many
    disjoint /24s are available) this is the only choice. Also, configuring
    additional subnet has the advantage of not disrupting the operation of
    existing devices.</p><p>Another very frequent use case comes from cable networks. There are two types
    of devices in cable networks: cable modems and the end user devices behind
    them. It is a common practice to use different subnet for cable modems to
    prevent users from tinkering with their cable modems. In this case, the
    distinction is based on the type of device, rather than address space
    exhaustion.</p><p>A client connected to a shared network may be assigned an address from
    any of the address pools defined within the subnets belonging to the shared
    network. Internally, the server selects one of the subnets belonging to a
    shared network and tries to allocate an address from this subnet. If the
    server is unable to allocate an address from the selected subnet (e.g. due
    to address pools exhaustion) it will use another subnet from the same shared
    network and try to allocate an address from this subnet etc. Therefore, in the
    typical case, the server will allocate all addresses available for a given
    subnet before it starts allocating addresses from other subnets belonging to
    the same shared network. However, in certain situations the client can be
    allocated an address from the other subnets before the address pools in the
    first subnet get exhausted, e.g. when the client provides a hint that
    belongs to another subnet or the client has reservations in a different than
    default subnet.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>It is strongly discouraged for the Kea deployments to assume that the
      server doesn't allocate addresses from other subnets until it uses all
      the addresses from the first subnet in the shared network. Apart from the
      fact that hints, host reservations and client classification affect subnet
      selection, it is also foreseen that we will enhance allocation strategies
      for shared networks in the future versions of Kea, so as the selection
      of subnets within a shared network is equally probable (unpredictable).</p></div><p>In order to define a shared network an additional configuration scope

</pre><p>
    </p><p>As you see in the example, it is possible to mix shared and regular
    ("plain") subnets. Each shared network must have a unique name. This is
    similar to ID for subnets, but gives you more flexibility. This is used
    for logging, but also internally for identifying shared networks.</p><p>In principle it makes sense to define only shared networks that
    consist of two or more subnets. However, for testing purposes it is allowed
    to define a shared network with just one subnet or even an empty one.  This
    is not a recommended practice in production networks, as the shared network
    logic requires additional processing and thus lowers server's performance.
    To avoid unnecessary performance degradation the shared subnets should only
    be defined when required by the deployment.
    </p><p>Shared networks provide an ability to specify many parameters in
    the shared network scope that will apply to all subnets within it. If
    necessary, you can specify a parameter on the shared network scope and then
    override its value in the subnet scope. For example:
</p><pre class="screen">

    In this example, there is a log-servers option defined that is available to
    clients in both subnets in this shared network. Also, a valid lifetime is
    set to 10 minutes (600s). However, the first subnet overrides some of the values
    (valid lifetime is 20 minutes, different IP address for log-servers), but
    also adds its own option (router address). Assuming a client asking for
    router and log servers options is assigned a lease from this subnet, he will
    get a lease for 20 minutes and log-servers and routers value of 10.0.0.254.
    If the same client is assigned to the second subnet, he will get a 10
    minutes long lease, log-servers value of 1.2.3.4 and routers set to 192.0.2.1.

    tell the server that this specific shared network is reachable directly (not
    via relays) using local network interface. It is sufficient to specify
    it once on the shared network level. As all subnets in a shared network are
    expected to be used on the same physical link, it is a configuration error
    to attempt to define a shared network using subnets that are reachable over
    different interfaces. It is allowed to specify interface parameter on each

</p><p>Somewhat similar to interface names, also relay IP addresses can be
specified for the whole shared network. However, depending on your relay
configuration, it may use different IP addresses depending on which subnet
is being used. Thus there is no requirement to use the same IP relay address
for each subnet. Here's an example:

</p><pre class="screen">
"shared-networks": [

            }
        ]
    }
]</pre><p>
In this particular case the relay IP address specified on network level doesn't
have much sense, as it is overridden in both subnets, but it was left there
as an example of how one could be defined on network level. Note that the
relay agent IP address typically belongs to the subnet it relays packets from,
but this is not a strict requirement. Therefore Kea accepts any value here
as long as it is valid IPv4 address.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp57004464"></a>8.4.2.Â Client classification in shared networks</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes it is desired to segregate clients into specific subnets
      based on some properties. This mechanism is called client classification
      and is described in <a class="xref" href="#classify" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Client Classification">ChapterÂ 13, <i>Client Classification</i></a>. Client classification
      can be applied to subnets belonging to shared networks in the same way
      as it is used for subnets specified outside of shared networks.
      It is important to understand how the server selects subnets for
      the clients when client classification is in use, to assure that the
      desired subnet is selected for a given client type.</p><p>If a subnet is associated with some classes, only the clients
      belonging to any of these classes can use this subnet. If there are no
      classes specified for a subnet, any client connected to a given shared
      network can use this subnet. A common mistake is to assume that the
      subnet including client classes is preferred over subnets without
      client classes. Consider the following example:

</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "client-classes": [
        {
            "name": "b-devices",
            "test": "option[93].hex == 0x0002"
        }
    ],
    "shared-networks": [
        {
            "name": "galah",
            "interface": "eth0",
            "subnet4": [
                {
                    "subnet": "192.0.2.0/26",
                    "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.63" } ],
                },
                {
                    "subnet": "10.0.0.0/24",
                    "pools": [ { "pool": "10.0.0.2 - 10.0.0.250" } ],
                    <strong class="userinput"><code>"client-class": "b-devices"</code></strong>
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>

        If the client belongs to "b-devices" class (because it includes option
        93 with a value of 0x0002) it doesn't guarantee that the subnet 10.0.0.0/24
        will be used (or preferred) for this client. The server can use any of
        the two subnets because the subnet 192.0.2.0/26 is also allowed for
        this client. The client classification used in this case should be pereceived
        as a way to restrict access to certain subnets, rather than a way to express
        subnet preference. For example, if the client doesn't belong to the
        "b-devices" class it may only use the subnet 192.0.2.0/26 and will
        never use the subnet 10.0.0.0/24.
      </p><p>A typical use case for client classification is in the cable network,
      where cable modems should use one subnet and other devices should use
      another subnet within the same shared network. In this case it is required
      to apply classification on all subnets. The following example defines two
      classes of devices. The subnet selection is  made based on option 93 values.

In this example each class has its own restriction. Only clients that belong to
class "a-devices" will be able to use subnet 192.0.2.0/26 and only clients
belonging to b-devices will be able to use subnet 10.0.0.0/24. Care should be
taken to not define too restrictive classification rules, as clients that are
unable to use any subnets will be refused service. Although, this may be a
desired outcome if one desires to service only clients of known properties
(e.g. only VoIP phones allowed on a given link).</p><p>
      Note that it is possible to achieve similar effect as presented in this
      section without the use of shared networks. If the subnets are placed in
      the global subnets scope, rather than in the shared network, the server
      will still use classification rules to pick the right subnet for a given
      class of devices. The major benefit of placing subnets within the
      shared network is that common parameters for the logically grouped
      subnets can be specified once, in the shared network scope, e.g.
      "interface" or "relay" parameter. All subnets belonging to this shared
      network will inherit those parameters.

</p><p>It is worth noting that Kea conducts additional checks when processing a
packet if shared networks are defined. First, instead of simply checking if
there's a reservation for a given client in his initially selected subnet, it
goes through all subnets in a shared network looking for a reservation. This is
one of the reasons why defining a shared network may impact performance. If
there is a reservation for a client in any subnet, that particular subnet will
be picked for the client. Although it's technically not an error, it is
considered a bad practice to define reservations for the same host in multiple
subnets belonging to the same shared network.</p><p>While not strictly mandatory, it is strongly recommended to use explicit
"id" values for subnets if you plan to use database storage for host
reservations. If ID is not specified, the values for it be autogenerated,
i.e. it will assign increasing integer values starting from 1. Thus, the
autogenerated IDs are not stable across configuration changes.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dhcp4-serverid"></a>8.5.Â Server Identifier in DHCPv4</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The DHCPv4 protocol uses a "server identifier" to allow clients
        to discriminate between several servers present on the same link: this
        value is an IPv4 address of the server. The server chooses the IPv4 address
        of the interface on which the message from the client (or relay) has been
        received. A single server instance will use multiple server identifiers
        if it is receiving queries on multiple interfaces.
      </p><p>
        It is possible to override default server identifier values by specifying
        "dhcp-server-identifier" option. This option is only supported on the
        global, shared network and subnet level. It must not be specified
        on client class and host reservation level.
      </p><p>
        The following example demonstrates how to override server identifier for
        a subnet:
</p><pre class="screen">

        The DHCPv4 server differentiates between the directly connected clients,
        clients trying to renew leases and clients sending their messages through
        relays. For directly connected clients, the server will check the
        configuration for the interface on which the message has been received and,
        if the server configuration doesn't match any configured subnet, the
        message is discarded.</p><p>Assuming that the server's interface is configured with the
        IPv4 address 192.0.2.3, the server will only process messages received through
        this interface from a directly connected client if there is a subnet
        configured to which this IPv4 address belongs, e.g. 192.0.2.0/24.
        The server will use this subnet to assign IPv4 address for the client.
      </p><p>
        The rule above does not apply when the client unicasts its message, i.e.
        is trying to renew its lease. Such a message is accepted through any
        interface. The renewing client sets ciaddr to the currently used IPv4
        address. The server uses this address to select the subnet for the client
        (in particular, to extend the lease using this address).
      </p><p>
        If the message is relayed it is accepted through any interface. The giaddr
        set by the relay agent is used to select the subnet for the client.
      </p><p>
        It is also possible to specify a relay IPv4 address for a given subnet. It
        can be used to match incoming packets into a subnet in uncommon configurations,
        e.g. shared networks. See <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-relay-override" title="8.6.1.Â Using a Specific Relay Agent for a Subnet">SectionÂ 8.6.1, âUsing a Specific Relay Agent for a Subnetâ</a> for details.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The subnet selection mechanism described in this section is based
        on the assumption that client classification is not used. The classification
        mechanism alters the way in which a subnet is selected for the client,
        depending on the classes to which the client belongs.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp4-relay-override"></a>8.6.1.Â Using a Specific Relay Agent for a Subnet</h3></div></div></div><p>
        A relay has to have an interface connected to the link on which
        the clients are being configured. Typically the relay has an IPv4
        address configured on that interface that belongs to the subnet from which
        the server will assign addresses. In the typical case, the
        server is able to use the IPv4 address inserted by the relay (in the giaddr
        field of the DHCPv4 packet) to select the appropriate subnet.
      </p><p>
        However, that is not always the case. In certain uncommon â
        but valid â deployments, the relay address may not match the subnet. This
        usually means that there is more than one subnet allocated for a given
        link. The two most common examples where this is the case are long lasting
        network renumbering (where both old and new address space is still being
        used) and a cable network. In a cable network both cable modems and the
        devices behind them are physically connected to the same link, yet
        they use distinct addressing. In such a case, the DHCPv4 server needs
        additional information (the IPv4 address of the relay) to properly select
        an appropriate subnet.
      </p><p>
        The following example assumes that there is a subnet 192.0.2.0/24
        that is accessible via a relay that uses 10.0.0.1 as its IPv4 address.
        The server will be able to select this subnet for any incoming packets
        that came from a relay that has an address in 192.0.2.0/24 subnet.
        It will also select that subnet for a relay with address 10.0.0.1.

          In certain cases, it is useful to mix relay address information,
          introduced in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-relay-override" title="8.6.1.Â Using a Specific Relay Agent for a Subnet">SectionÂ 8.6.1, âUsing a Specific Relay Agent for a Subnetâ</a> with client
          classification, explained in <a class="xref" href="#classify" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Client Classification">ChapterÂ 13, <i>Client Classification</i></a>.
          One specific example is cable network, where typically modems
          get addresses from a different subnet than all devices connected
          behind them.
        </p><p>
          Let us assume that there is one CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System)
          with one CM MAC (a physical link that modems are connected to).
          We want the modems to get addresses from the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet, while
          everything connected behind modems should get addresses from another
          subnet (192.0.2.0/24). The CMTS that acts as a relay uses address
          10.1.1.1. The following configuration can serve that configuration:

      that it is expected to hand out to the DHCPv4 clients.  It is
      assumed that the server is authoritative and has complete jurisdiction
      over those addresses. However, due to various reasons, such as
      misconfiguration or a faulty client implementation that retains its
      address beyond the valid lifetime, there may be devices connected that use
      those addresses without the server's approval or knowledge.</p><p>Such an
      unwelcome event can be detected by legitimate clients (using ARP or ICMP
      Echo Request mechanisms) and reported to the DHCPv4 server using a DHCPDECLINE
      message. The server will do a sanity check (if the client declining an
      address really was supposed to use it), and then will conduct a clean up
      operation. Any DNS entries related to that address will be removed, the
      fact will be logged and hooks will be triggered. After that is done, the
      address will be marked as declined (which indicates that it is used by an
      unknown entity and thus not available for assignment to anyone) and a
      probation time will be set on it. Unless otherwise configured, the
      probation period lasts 24 hours. After that period, the server will
      recover the lease (i.e. put it back into the available state) and the address will
      be available for assignment again. It should be noted that if the
      underlying issue of a misconfigured device is not resolved, the duplicate
      address scenario will repeat. On the other hand, it provides an
      opportunity to recover from such an event automatically, without any
      sysadmin intervention.</p><p>To configure the decline probation period to a value other
      than the default, the following syntax can be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
  "Dhcp4": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"decline-probation-period": 3600</code></strong>,
    "subnet4": [ ... ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The parameter is expressed in seconds, so the example above will instruct
      the server to recycle declined leases after an hour.</p><p>There are several statistics and hook points associated with the
      Decline handling procedure. The lease4_decline hook is triggered after the
      incoming DHCPDECLINE message has been sanitized and the server is about to
      decline the lease. The declined-addresses statistic is increased after the
      hook returns (both global and subnet specific variants). (See
      <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-stats" title="8.8.Â Statistics in the DHCPv4 Server">SectionÂ 8.8, âStatistics in the DHCPv4 Serverâ</a> and <a class="xref" href="#hooks-libraries" title="ChapterÂ 14.Â Hooks Libraries">ChapterÂ 14, <i>Hooks Libraries</i></a> for more details
      on DHCPv4 statistics and Kea hook points.)</p><p>Once the probation time elapses, the declined lease is recovered
      using the standard expired lease reclamation procedure, with several
      additional steps. In particular, both declined-addresses statistics
      (global and subnet specific) are decreased. At the same time,
      reclaimed-declined-addresses statistics (again in two variants, global and
      subnet specific) are increased.</p><p>Note about statistics: The server does not decrease the
      assigned-addresses statistics when a DHCPDECLINE is received and processed
      successfully. While technically a declined address is no longer assigned,
      the primary usage of the assigned-addresses statistic is to monitor pool
      utilization. Most people would forget to include declined-addresses in the
      calculation, and simply do assigned-addresses/total-addresses. This would
      have a bias towards under-representing pool utilization. As this has a
      potential for major issues, we decided not to decrease assigned addresses
      immediately after receiving DHCPDECLINE, but to do it later when we
      recover the address back to the available pool.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dhcp4-stats"></a>8.8.Â Statistics in the DHCPv4 Server</h2></div></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This section describes DHCPv4-specific statistics.

        The management API allows the issuing of specific

        For more details, see <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel" title="ChapterÂ 16.Â Management API">ChapterÂ 16, <i>Management API</i></a>. Currently the only
        supported communication channel type is UNIX stream socket. By default there
        are no sockets open. To instruct Kea to open a socket, the following entry
        in the configuration file can be used:
</p><pre class="screen">

}
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        The length of the path specified by the <span class="command"><strong>socket-name</strong></span>
        parameter is restricted by the maximum length for the unix socket name

        field in the <span class="command"><strong>sockaddr_un</strong></span> structure, decreased by 1.
        This value varies on different operating systems between 91 and 107
        characters. Typical values are 107 on Linux and 103 on FreeBSD.
      </p><p>
        Communication over control channel is conducted using JSON structures.

          Kea allows loading hook libraries that sometimes could benefit from
          additional parameters. If such a parameter is specific to the whole
          library, it is typically defined as a parameter for the hook library.
          However, sometimes there is a need to specify parameters that are
          different for each pool.
        </p><p>
          User contexts can store arbitrary data as long as it is valid JSON
          syntax and its top level element is a map (i.e. the data must be
          enclosed in curly brackets). Some hook libraries may expect specific
          formatting, though.  Please consult specific hook library
          documentation for details.
        </p><p>
          User contexts can be specified on either global scope,
          shared network, subnet, pool, client class, option data or
          definition level, and host reservation. One other useful
          usage is the ability to store comments or descriptions.
        </p><p>
          Let's consider an imaginary case of devices that have color LED
          lights. Depending on their location, they should glow red, blue or
          green. It would be easy to write a hook library that would send
          specific values as maybe a vendor option. However, the server has to
          have some way to specify that value for each pool. This need is
          addressed by user contexts. In essence, any user data can specified
          in the user context as long as it is a valid JSON map. For example,
          the forementioned case of LED devices could be configured in the
          following way:

          </p><pre class="screen">

            } ],

            // This is a subnet specific user context. You can put whatever type
            // of information you want as long as it is a valid JSON.
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"user-context": {
                "comment": "network on the second floor",
                "last-modified": "2017-09-04 13:32",
                "description": "you can put here anything you like",
                "phones": [ "x1234", "x2345" ],

    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
        </p><p>
          It should be noted that Kea will not use that information, but will
          simply store and make it available to hook libraries. It is up to the
          hook library to extract that information and make use of it.
          The parser translates a "comment" entry into a user-context
          with the entry, this allows to attach a comment inside the
          configuration itself.

        It is recommended that the Kea DHCPv6 server be started and stopped
        using <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> (described in <a class="xref" href="#keactrl" title="ChapterÂ 6.Â Managing Kea with keactrl">ChapterÂ 6, <i>Managing Kea with keactrl</i></a>).
        However, it is also possible to run the server directly: it accepts
        the following command-line switches:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-c <em class="replaceable"><code>file</code></em></strong></span> -

            <span class="command"><strong>-d</strong></span> - specifies whether the server
            logging should be switched to verbose mode. In verbose mode,
            the logging severity and debuglevel specified in the configuration
            file are ignored and "debug" severity and the maximum debuglevel
            (99) are assumed. The flag is convenient, for temporarily
            switching the server into maximum verbosity, e.g. when
            debugging.</li><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-p <em class="replaceable"><code>port</code></em></strong></span> -
            specifies UDP port on which the server will listen. This is only
            useful during testing, as a DHCPv6 server listening on
            ports other than the standard ones will not be able to
            handle regular DHCPv6 queries.</li><li class="listitem">

            checks. Note that certain checks are possible only while
            running the actual server. The actual status is reported
            with exit code (0 = configuration looks ok, 1 = error
            encountered). Kea will print out log messages to standard
            output and error to standard error when testing

            </li></ul></div><p>
        The <code class="filename">config.report</code> may also be accessed more
        directly.  The following command may be used to extract this
        information.  The binary <strong class="userinput"><code>path</code></strong> may be found
        in the install directory or in the <code class="filename">.libs</code>
        subdirectory in the source tree. For example
        <code class="filename">kea/src/bin/dhcp6/.libs/kea-dhcp6</code>.

</p><pre class="screen">
strings <strong class="userinput"><code>path</code></strong>/kea-dhcp6 | sed -n 's/;;;; //p'
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        On start-up, the server will detect available network interfaces
        and will attempt to open UDP sockets on all interfaces
        mentioned in the configuration file.
        Since the DHCPv6 server opens privileged ports, it requires root
        access. Make sure you run this daemon as root.
      </p><p>
        During startup the server will attempt to create a PID file of the
        form: localstatedir]/[conf name].kea-dhcp6.pid where:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>localstatedir</strong></span>: The value as passed into the
            build configure script. It defaults to "/usr/local/var".  Note
            that this value may be overridden at run time by setting the environment
            variable KEA_PIDFILE_DIR.  This is intended primarily for testing purposes.
            </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>conf name</strong></span>: The configuration file name
            used to start the server, minus all preceding path and file extension.
            For example, given a pathname of "/usr/local/etc/kea/myconf.txt", the
            portion used would be "myconf".
            </li></ul></div><p>
        If the file already exists and contains the PID of a live process,
        the server will issue a DHCP6_ALREADY_RUNNING log message and exit. It
        is possible, though unlikely, that the file is a remnant of a system crash
        and the process to which the PID belongs is unrelated to Kea.  In such a
        case it would be necessary to manually delete the PID file.
      </p><p>
        The server can be stopped using the <span class="command"><strong>kill</strong></span> command.
        When running in a console, the server can be shut down by
        pressing ctrl-c. It detects the key combination and shuts
        down gracefully.

        This section explains how to configure the DHCPv6 server using the
        Kea configuration backend. (Kea configuration using any other
        backends is outside of scope of this document.) Before DHCPv6
        is started, its configuration file has to be created. The
        basic configuration is as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
# DHCPv6 configuration starts on the next line
"Dhcp6": {

# First we set up global values
    "valid-lifetime": 4000,
    "renew-timer": 1000,
    "rebind-timer": 2000,
    "preferred-lifetime": 3000,

# Next we setup the interfaces to be used by the server.
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ "eth0" ]
    },

# And we specify the type of lease database
    "lease-database": {
        "type": "memfile",
        "persist": true,
        "name": "/var/kea/dhcp6.leases"
    },

# Finally, we list the subnets from which we will be leasing addresses.
    "subnet6": [
        {
            "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
            "pools": [
                 {
                     "pool": "2001:db8:1::1-2001:db8:1::ffff"
                 }
             ]
        }
    ]
# DHCPv6 configuration ends with the next line
}

} </pre><p>
</p><p>The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the parameters in
the above example together with
their format. Subsequent sections of this chapter go into much greater detail
for these and other parameters.</p><p>The lines starting with a hash (#) are comments and are ignored by
the server; they do not impact its
operation in any way.</p><p>The configuration starts in the first line with the initial
opening curly bracket (or brace). Each configuration consists of
one or more objects. In this specific example, we have only one
object, called Dhcp6. This is a simplified configuration, as usually
there will be additional objects, like <span class="command"><strong>Logging</strong></span> or
<span class="command"><strong>DhcpDdns</strong></span>, but we omit them now for clarity. The Dhcp6
configuration starts with the <span class="command"><strong>"Dhcp6": {</strong></span> line
and ends with the corresponding closing brace (in the above example,
the brace after the last comment).  Everything defined between those
lines is considered to be the Dhcp6 configuration.</p><p>In the general case, the order in which those parameters appear does not
matter. There are two caveats here though. The first one is to remember that
the configuration file must be well formed JSON. That means that parameters
for any given scope must be separated by a comma and there must not be a comma
after the last parameter. When reordering a configuration file, keep in mind that
moving a parameter to or from the last position in a given scope may also require
moving the comma. The second caveat is that it is uncommon â although
legal JSON â to
repeat the same parameter multiple times. If that happens, the last occurrence of a
given parameter in a given scope is used while all previous instances are
ignored. This is unlikely to cause any confusion as there are no real life
reasons to keep multiple copies of the same parameter in your configuration
file.</p><p>Moving onto the DHCPv6 configuration elements, the very first few elements
define some global parameters. <span class="command"><strong>valid-lifetime</strong></span>
defines for how long the addresses (leases) given out by the server are valid. If
nothing changes, a client that got an address is allowed to use it for 4000
seconds. (Note that integer numbers are specified as is, without any quotes
around them.) The address will become deprecated in 3000 seconds (clients are
allowed to keep old connections, but can't use this address for creating new
connections). <span class="command"><strong>renew-timer</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong> rebind-timer</strong></span> are values that define T1 and T2 timers that
govern when the client will begin the renewal and rebind procedures.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>interfaces-config</strong></span> map specifies the server
configuration concerning the network interfaces, on which the server should
listen to the DHCP messages. The <span class="command"><strong>interfaces</strong></span> parameter
specifies a list of network interfaces on which the server should listen.
Lists are opened and closed with square brackets, with elements separated
by commas. Had we wanted to listen on two interfaces, the
<span class="command"><strong>interfaces-config</strong></span> would look like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
"interfaces-config": {
    "interfaces": [ "eth0", "eth1" ]
},
</pre><p>
</p><p>The next couple of lines define the lease database, the place where the server
stores its lease information. This particular example tells the server to use
<span class="command"><strong>memfile</strong></span>, which is the simplest (and fastest) database
backend. It uses an in-memory database and stores leases on disk in a CSV
file. This is a very simple configuration. Usually the lease database configuration
is more extensive and contains additional parameters.  Note that
<span class="command"><strong>lease-database</strong></span>
is an object and opens up a new scope, using an opening brace.
Its parameters (just one in this example - <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span>)
follow. Had there been more than one, they would be separated by commas. This
scope is closed with a closing brace. As more parameters for the Dhcp6 definition
follow, a trailing comma is present.</p><p>Finally, we need to define a list of IPv6 subnets. This is the
most important DHCPv6 configuration structure as the server uses that
information to process clients' requests. It defines all subnets from
which the server is expected to receive DHCP requests. The subnets are
specified with the <span class="command"><strong>subnet6</strong></span> parameter.  It is a list,
so it starts and ends with square brackets.  Each subnet definition in
the list has several attributes associated with it, so it is a structure
and is opened and closed with braces. At minimum, a subnet definition
has to have at least two parameters: <span class="command"><strong>subnet</strong></span> (that
defines the whole subnet) and <span class="command"><strong>pools</strong></span> (which is a list of
dynamically allocated pools that are governed by the DHCP server).</p><p>The example contains a single subnet. Had more than one been defined,
additional elements
in the <span class="command"><strong>subnet6</strong></span> parameter would be specified and
separated by commas. For example, to define two subnets, the following
syntax would be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
"subnet6": [
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool": "2001:db8:1::/112" } ],
        "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64"
    },
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool": "2001:db8:2::1-2001:db8:2::ffff" } ],
        "subnet": "2001:db8:2::/64"
    }
]
</pre><p>
Note that indentation is optional and is used for aesthetic purposes only.
In some cases in may be preferable to use more compact notation.
</p><p>After all parameters are specified, we have two contexts open:
global and Dhcp6, hence we need two closing curly brackets to close them.
In a real life configuration file there most likely would be additional
components defined such as Logging or DhcpDdns, so the closing brace would
be followed by a comma and another object definition.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp57194368"></a>9.2.2.Â Lease Storage</h3></div></div></div><p>All leases issued by the server are stored in the lease database.
  Currently there are four database backends available:  memfile (which is the
  default backend), MySQL, PostgreSQL and Cassandra.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp57216128"></a>9.2.2.1.Â Memfile - Basic Storage for Leases</h4></div></div></div><p>The server is able to store lease data in different repositories. Larger
  deployments may elect to store leases in a database. <a class="xref" href="#database-configuration6" title="9.2.2.2.Â Lease Database Configuration">SectionÂ 9.2.2.2, âLease Database Configurationâ</a> describes this option. In typical
  smaller deployments though, the server will store lease information in a CSV file rather
  than a database. As well as requiring less administration, an
  advantage of using a file for storage is that it
  eliminates a dependency on third-party database software.</p><p>The configuration of the file backend (Memfile) is controlled through
  the Dhcp6/lease-database parameters. The <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> parameter
  is mandatory and it specifies which storage for leases the server should use.
  The value of <strong class="userinput"><code>"memfile"</code></strong> indicates that the file should
  be used as the storage. The following list gives additional, optional,
  parameters that can be used to configure the Memfile backend.

  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>persist</strong></span>: controls whether the new leases and
      updates to existing leases are written to the file. It is strongly
      recommended that the value of this parameter is set to
      <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong> at all times, during the server's normal
      operation. Not writing leases to disk will mean that if a server is restarted
      (e.g. after a power failure), it will not know what addresses have been
      assigned.  As a result, it may hand out addresses to new clients that are
      already in use. The value of <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong> is mostly useful
      for performance testing purposes. The default value of the
      <span class="command"><strong>persist</strong></span> parameter is <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>,
      which enables writing lease updates
      to the lease file.
      </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>: specifies an absolute location of the lease
      file in which new leases and lease updates will be recorded. The default value
      for this parameter is <strong class="userinput"><code>"[kea-install-dir]/var/kea/kea-leases6.csv"
      </code></strong>.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span>: specifies the interval in seconds, at
      which the server will perform a lease file cleanup (LFC).  This
      removes redundant (historical) information from the lease file
      and effectively reduces the lease file size. The cleanup process is described
      in more detailed fashion further in this section. The default value of the
      <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> is <strong class="userinput"><code>3600</code></strong>. A value of 0
      disables the LFC.</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>An example configuration of the Memfile backend is presented below:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "lease-database": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"type": "memfile"</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"persist": true</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "/tmp/kea-leases6.csv"</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"lfc-interval": 1800</code></strong>
    }
}
</pre><p>

    This configuration selects the <code class="filename">/tmp/kea-leases6.csv</code> as
    the storage for lease information and enables persistence (writing lease updates
    to this file). It also configures the backend perform the periodic cleanup
    of the lease files, executed every 30 minutes.
  </p><p>It is important to know how the lease file contents are organized
  to understand why the periodic lease file cleanup is needed. Every time
  the server updates a lease or creates a new lease for the client, the new
  lease information must be recorded in the lease file. For performance reasons,
  the server does not update the existing client's lease in the file, as it would
  potentially require rewriting the entire file. Instead, it simply appends the new lease
  information to the end of the file: the previous lease entries for the
  client are not removed. When the server loads leases from the lease file, e.g.
  at the server startup, it assumes that the latest lease entry for the client
  is the valid one. The previous entries are discarded. This means that the
  server can re-construct the accurate information about the leases even though
  there may be many lease entries for each client. However, storing many entries
  for each client results in bloated lease file and impairs the performance of
  the server's startup and reconfiguration as it needs to process a larger number
  of lease entries.
  </p><p>Lease file cleanup (LFC) removes all previous entries for each client and
  leaves only the latest ones. The interval at which the cleanup is performed
  is configurable, and it should be selected according to the frequency of lease
  renewals initiated by the clients. The more frequent the renewals, the smaller
  the value of <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> should be. Note however, that the
  LFC takes time and thus it is possible (although unlikely) that new cleanup
  is started while the previous cleanup instance is still running, if the
  <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> is too short. The server would recover from
  this by skipping the new cleanup when it detects that the previous cleanup
  is still in progress. But it implies that the actual cleanups will be
  triggered more rarely than configured. Moreover, triggering a new cleanup
  adds an overhead to the server which will not be able to respond to new
  requests for a short period of time when the new cleanup process is spawned.
  Therefore, it is recommended that the <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> value
  is selected in a way that would allow for the LFC to complete the cleanup before a
  new cleanup is triggered.
  </p><p>Lease file cleanup is performed by a separate process (in background) to avoid
  a performance impact on the server process. In order to avoid the conflicts
  between two processes both using the same lease files, the LFC process
  operates on the copy of the original lease file, rather than on the lease
  file used by the server to record lease updates. There are also other files
  being created as a side effect of the lease file cleanup. The detailed
  description of the LFC is located on the Kea wiki:
  <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://kea.isc.org/wiki/LFCDesign" target="_top">http://kea.isc.org/wiki/LFCDesign</a></code>.

  Should the database use a port different than default, it may be
  specified as well:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"port" : 12345</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
  Should the database be located on a different system, you may need to specify a longer interval
  for the connection timeout:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"connect-timeout" : <em class="replaceable"><code>timeout-in-seconds</code></em></code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
The default value of five seconds should be more than adequate for local connections.
If a timeout is given though, it should be an integer greater than zero.
  </p><p>
The maxiumum number of times the server will automatically attempt to reconnect to
the lease database after connectivity has been lost may be specified:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"max-reconnect-tries" : <em class="replaceable"><code>number-of-tries</code></em></code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
If the server is unable to reconnect to the database after making the maximum number
of attempts the server will exit. A value of zero (the default) disables automatic
recovery and the server will exit immediately upon detecting a loss of connectivity
(MySQL and Postgres only).
  </p><p>
The number of seconds the server will wait in between attempts to reconnect to the
lease database after connectivity has been lost may also be specified:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"reconnect-wait-time" : <em class="replaceable"><code>number-of-seconds</code></em></code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
A value of zero (the default) disables automatic recovery and the server will exit
immediately upon detecting a loss of connectivity (MySQL and Postgres only).
  </p><p>
    Note that host parameter is used by MySQL and PostgreSQL
    backends. Cassandra has a concept of contact points that could be
    used to contact the cluster, instead of a single IP or
    hostname. It takes a list of comma separated IP addresses. This may be specified as:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"contact-points" : "192.0.2.1,192.0.2.2"</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
  </p><p>Finally, the credentials of the account under which the server will
  access the database should be set:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { "lease-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"user": "<em class="replaceable"><code>user-name</code></em>"</code></strong>,

                              ... },
           ... }
</pre><p>

    that both storage methods (configuration file and one of the supported databases)

In some deployments the database user whose name is specified in the database backend
configuration may not have write privileges to the database. This is often
required by the policy within a given network to secure the data from being
unintentionally modified. In many cases administrators have inventory databases
deployed, which contain substantially more information about the hosts than
static reservations assigned to them. The inventory database can be used to create
a view of a Kea hosts database and such view is often read only.
</p><p>
Kea host database backends operate with an implicit configuration to both
read from and write to the database. If the database user does not have
write access to the host database, the backend will fail to start and the
server will refuse to start (or reconfigure). However, if access to a read
only host database is required for retrieving reservations for clients
and/or assign specific addresses and options, it is possible to explicitly
configure Kea to start in "read-only" mode. This is controlled by the
<span class="command"><strong>readonly</strong></span> boolean parameter as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { "hosts-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"readonly": true</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
Setting this parameter to <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong> would configure the
database backend to operate in "read-write" mode, which is also a default
configuration if the parameter is not specified.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The <span class="command"><strong>readonly</strong></span> parameter is currently only supported

  interfaces.  The simplest network interface configuration instructs the server to
  listen on all available interfaces:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"*"</code></strong> ]
    }
    ...
}
</pre><p>
  The asterisk plays the role of a wildcard and means "listen on all interfaces".
  However, it is usually a good idea to explicitly specify interface names:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
</p><p>It is possible to use wildcard interface name (asterisk) concurrently
  with the actual interface names:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3", "*"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
It is anticipated that this will form of usage only be used where it is desired to
temporarily override a list of interface names and listen on all interfaces.
  </p><p>As for the DHCPv4 server binding to specific addresses and
  disabling re-detection of interfaces are supported. But
  <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span> is not because DHCPv6 uses
  UDP/IPv6 sockets only. The following example shows how to disable the
  interface detection:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3"</code></strong> ],
        "re-detect": <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong>
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>The loopback interfaces (i.e. the "lo" or "lo0" interface)
  are not configured by default, unles explicitely mentioned in
  the configration. Note Kea requires a link-local address which does
  not exist on all systems, or a specified unicast address as in:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"lo/::1"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ipv6-subnet-id"></a>9.2.5.Â IPv6 Subnet Identifier</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The subnet identifier is a unique number associated with a particular subnet.
        In principle, it is used to associate clients' leases with their respective subnets.
        When a subnet identifier is not specified for a subnet being configured, it will
        be automatically assigned by the configuration mechanism. The identifiers
        are assigned from 1 and are monotonically increased for each subsequent
        subnet: 1, 2, 3 ....
      </p><p>
        If there are multiple subnets configured with auto-generated identifiers and
        one of them is removed, the subnet identifiers may be renumbered. For example:
        if there are four subnets and the third is removed the last subnet will be assigned
        the identifier that the third subnet had before removal. As a result, the leases
        stored in the lease database for subnet 3 are now associated with
        subnet 4, something that may have unexpected consequences. It is planned
        to implement a mechanism to preserve auto-generated subnet ids in a
        future version of Kea.  However, the only remedy for this issue
        at present is to
        manually specify a unique identifier for each subnet.
      </p><p>
        The following configuration will assign the specified subnet
        identifier to the newly configured subnet:

        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "subnet6": [
        {
            "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"id": 1024</code></strong>,
            ...
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
        This identifier will not change for this subnet unless the "id" parameter is
        removed or set to 0. The value of 0 forces auto-generation of the subnet
        identifier.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp6-unicast"></a>9.2.6.Â Unicast Traffic Support</h3></div></div></div><p>
        When the DHCPv6 server starts, by default it listens to the DHCP traffic
        sent to multicast address ff02::1:2 on each interface that it is
        configured to listen on (see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-interface-selection" title="9.2.4.Â Interface Selection">SectionÂ 9.2.4, âInterface Selectionâ</a>).
        In some cases it is useful to configure a server to handle incoming
        traffic sent to the global unicast addresses as well. The most common
        reason for this is to have relays send their traffic to the server
        directly. To configure the server to listen on a specific unicast address,
        nn interface name can be
        optionally followed by a slash, followed by the global unicast address on which
        the server should listen. The server listens to this address in addition to normal
        link-local binding and listening on ff02::1:2 address. The sample configuration
        below shows how to listen on 2001:db8::1 (a global address)
        configured on the eth1 interface.
      </p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1/2001:db8::1"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
    "option-data": [
        {
            "name": "unicast",
            "data": "2001:db8::1"
        } ],
    ...
}
 </pre><p>

        This configuration will cause the server to listen on
        eth1 on the link-local address, the multicast group (ff02::1:2) and 2001:db8::1.
      </p><p>
        Usually unicast support is associated with a server unicast option
        which allows clients to send unicast messages to the server.
        The example above includes a server unicast option specification
        which will cause the client to send messages to the specified
        unicast address.
      </p><p>
        It is possible to mix interface names, wildcards and interface name/addresses
        in the list of interfaces. It is not possible however to specify more than one
        unicast address on a given interface.
      </p><p>
        Care should be taken to specify proper unicast addresses. The server will
        attempt to bind to the addresses specified without any additional checks.
        This approach has selected on purpose to allow the software to
        communicate over uncommon addresses if so desired.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp6-address-config"></a>9.2.7.Â Subnet and Address Pool</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The main role of a DHCPv6 server is address assignment. For this,
        the server has to be configured with at least one subnet and one pool of dynamic
        addresses to be managed. For example, assume that the server
        is connected to a network segment that uses the 2001:db8:1::/64
        prefix. The Administrator of that network has decided that addresses from range
        2001:db8:1::1 to 2001:db8:1::ffff are going to be managed by the Dhcp6
        server. Such a configuration can be achieved in the following way:
        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"subnet6": [
       {
           "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
           "pools": [
               {
                   "pool": "2001:db8:1::1-2001:db8:1::ffff"
               }
           ],
           ...
       }
    ]</code></strong>
}</pre><p>

        Note that <span class="command"><strong>subnet</strong></span> is defined as a simple string, but
        the <span class="command"><strong>pools</strong></span> parameter is actually a list of pools: for
        this reason, the pool definition is enclosed in square brackets, even
        though only one range of addresses is specified.</p><p>Each <span class="command"><strong>pool</strong></span> is a structure that contains the
        parameters that describe a single pool. Currently there is only one
        parameter, <span class="command"><strong>pool</strong></span>, which gives the range of addresses
        in the pool. Additional parameters will be added in future releases of
        Kea.</p><p>It is possible to define more than one pool in a
        subnet: continuing the previous example, further assume that
        2001:db8:1:0:5::/80 should also be managed by the server. It could be written as
        2001:db8:1:0:5:: to 2001:db8:1::5:ffff:ffff:ffff, but typing so many 'f's
        is cumbersome. It can be expressed more simply as 2001:db8:1:0:5::/80. Both
        formats are supported by Dhcp6 and can be mixed in the pool list.
        For example, one could define the following pools:
        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"subnet6": [
    {
        "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
        "pools": [
            { "pool": "2001:db8:1::1-2001:db8:1::ffff" },
            { "pool": "2001:db8:1:05::/80" }
        ]</code></strong>,
        ...
    }
    ]
}</pre><p>
        White space in pool definitions is ignored, so spaces before and after the hyphen are optional.
        They can be used to improve readability.
      </p><p>
        The number of pools is not limited, but for performance reasons it is recommended to
        use as few as possible.
      </p><p>
         The server may be configured to serve more than one subnet. To add a second subnet,
         use a command similar to the following:
        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"subnet6": [
    {
        "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
        "pools": [
            { "pool": "2001:db8:1::1-2001:db8:1::ffff" }
        ]
    },
    {
        "subnet": "2001:db8:2::/64",
        "pools": [
            { "pool": "2001:db8:2::/64" }
        ]
    },
</code></strong>
        ...
    ]
}</pre><p>
        In this example, we allow the server to
        dynamically assign all addresses available in the whole subnet. Although
        rather wasteful, it is certainly a valid configuration to dedicate the
        whole /64 subnet for that purpose. Note that the Kea server does not preallocate
        the leases, so there is no danger in using gigantic address pools.
      </p><p>
        When configuring a DHCPv6 server using prefix/length notation, please pay
        attention to the boundary values. When specifying that the server can use
        a given pool, it will also be able to allocate the first (typically network
        address) address from that pool. For example, for pool 2001:db8:2::/64 the
        2001:db8:2:: address may be assigned as well. If you want to avoid this,
        use the "min-max" notation.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp57326512"></a>9.2.8.Â Subnet and Prefix Delegation Pools</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Subnets may also be configured to delegate prefixes, as defined in
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3633" target="_top">RFC 3633</a>.  A
        subnet may have one or more prefix delegation pools.  Each pool has a

        (<span class="command"><strong>prefix</strong></span>) and a prefix length
        (<span class="command"><strong>prefix-len</strong></span>), as well as a delegated prefix length
        (<span class="command"><strong>delegated-len</strong></span>). The delegated length must not be
        shorter (that is it must be numerically greater or equal) than the
        prefix length.  If both the delegated and prefix lengths are equal, the
        server will be able to delegate only one prefix. The delegated prefix
        does not have to match the subnet prefix.

          For each delegated prefix the delegating router may choose to exclude
          a single prefix out of the delegated prefix as specified in the
          <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6603" target="_top"> RFC 6603</a>.
          The requesting router must not assign the excluded prefix to any
          of its downstream interfaces and it is intended to be used on a
          link through which the delegating router exchanges DHCPv6 messages with
          the requesting router. The configuration example below demonstrates how
          to specify an excluded prefix within a prefix pool definition. The
          excluded prefix "2001:db8:1:babe:cafe:80::/72" will be sent to a
          requesting router which includes Prefix Exclude option in the ORO, and
          which is delegated a prefix from this pool.

        One of the major features of a DHCPv6 server is to provide configuration
        options to clients.  Although there are several options that require
        special behavior, most options are sent by the server only if the client
        explicitly requests them.  The following example shows how to
        configure DNS servers, one of the most frequently used
        options.  Options specified in this way are considered
        global and apply to all configured subnets.

        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "option-data": [
        {
           <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "dns-servers",
           "code": 23,
           "space": "dhcp6",
           "csv-format": true,
           "data": "2001:db8::cafe, 2001:db8::babe"</code></strong>
        },
        ...
    ]
}
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
      The <span class="command"><strong>option-data</strong></span> line creates a new entry in
      the option-data table.  This table contains
      information on all global options that the server is supposed to configure
      in all subnets.  The <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> line specifies the option name.
      (For a complete list
      of currently supported names, see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-std-options-list" title="TableÂ 9.1.Â List of Standard DHCPv6 Options">TableÂ 9.1, âList of Standard DHCPv6 Optionsâ</a>.)  The next line specifies the option code,
      which must match one of the values from that list. The line beginning with
      <span class="command"><strong>space</strong></span> specifies the option space, which must always be set
      to "dhcp6" as these are standard DHCPv6 options.  For other name spaces,
      including custom option spaces, see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-option-spaces" title="9.2.14.Â Nested DHCPv6 Options (Custom Option Spaces)">SectionÂ 9.2.14, âNested DHCPv6 Options (Custom Option Spaces)â</a>. The following line specifies the format in
      which the data will be entered: use of CSV (comma separated values) is
      recommended. Finally, the <span class="command"><strong>data</strong></span> line gives the actual value to be sent to
      clients.  Data is specified as normal text, with values separated by
      commas if more than one value is allowed.
    </p><p>
      Options can also be configured as hexadecimal values.  If "csv-format" is
      set to false, the option data must be specified as a string of hexadecimal
      numbers.  The
      following commands configure the DNS-SERVERS option for all
      subnets with the following addresses: 2001:db8:1::cafe and
      2001:db8:1::babe.
        </p><pre class="screen">

       </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
       The value for the setting of the "data" element is split across two
       lines in this example for clarity: when entering the command, the
       whole string should be entered on the same line.
       </p></div><p>
       Care should be taken
       to use proper encoding when using hexadecimal format as Kea's ability
       to validate data correctness in hexadecimal is limited.
      </p><p>
        Most of the parameters in the "option-data" structure are
        optional and can be omitted in some circumstances as discussed
        in the <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-option-data-defaults" title="9.2.15.Â Unspecified Parameters for DHCPv6 Option Configuration">SectionÂ 9.2.15, âUnspecified Parameters for DHCPv6 Option Configurationâ</a>. Only one
        of name or code is required, so you don't need to specify
        both. Space has a default value of "dhcp6", so you can skip
        this as well if you define a regular (not encapsulated) DHCPv6
        option.  Finally, csv-format defaults to true, so it too can
        be skipped, unless you want to specify the option value as
        hexstring. Therefore the above example can be simplified to:
        </p><pre class="screen">

        Defined options are added to response when the client requests them

        The DNS Servers option is always added to responses
        (the always-send is "sticky") but the value is the subnet one
        when the client is localized in the subnet.
      </p><p>
      It is possible to override options on a per-subnet basis.  If
      clients connected to most of your subnets are expected to get the
      same values of a given option, you should use global options: you
      can then override specific values for a small number of subnets.
      On the other hand, if you use different values in each subnet,
      it does not make sense to specify global option values
      (Dhcp6/option-data), rather you should set only subnet-specific values
      (Dhcp6/subnet[X]/option-data[Y]).
     </p><p>
      The following commands override the global
      DNS servers option for a particular subnet, setting a single DNS
      server with address 2001:db8:1::3.

       In some cases it is useful to associate some options with an
       address or prefix pool from which a client is assigned a lease. Pool
       specific option values override subnet specific and global option
       values. If the client is assigned multiple leases from different
       pools, the server will assign options from all pools from which the
       leases have been obtained. However, if the particular option is specified
       in multiple pools from which the client obtains the leases, only one
       instance of this option will be handed out to the client. The server's
       administrator must not try to prioritize assignment of pool specific
       options by trying to order pools declarations in the server
       configuration. Future Kea releases may change the order in which
       options are assigned from the pools without any notice.
     </p><p>
       The following configuration snippet demonstrates how to specify the
       DNS servers option, which will be assigned to a client only if the
       client obtains an address from the given pool:

      Some options are designated as arrays, which means that more than one
      value is allowed in such an option. For example the option dns-servers
      allows the specification of more than one IPv6 address, allowing
      clients to obtain the addresses of multiple DNS servers.

      Options marked with (1) have option definitions, but the logic
      behind them is not implemented. That means that technically Kea
      knows how to parse them in incoming message or how to send them
      if configured to do so, but not what to do with them. Since the
      related RFCs require certain processing, the support for those
      options is non-functional. However, it may be useful in some
      limited lab testing, hence the definition formats are listed here.

        Softwire46 options are involved in IPv4 over IPv6 provisioning by
        means of tunneling or translation as specified in the
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7598" target="_top">RFC 7598</a>.
        The following sections provide configuration examples of these
        options.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="s46-containers"></a>9.2.11.1.Â Softwire46 Container Options</h4></div></div></div><p>
        S46 container options group rules and optional port parameters
        for a specified domain. There are three container options specified
        in the "dhcp6" (top level) option space: MAP-E Container option,
        MAP-T Container option and S46 Lightweight 4over6 Container option.
        These options only contain encapsulated options specified below.
        They do not include any data fields.
      </p><p>
        In order to configure the server to send specific container option
        along with all encapsulated options, the container option must be
        included in the server configuration as shown below:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    ...
    "option-data": [
        {
            "name": "s46-cont-mape"
        } ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>

        This configuration will cause the server to include MAP-E Container
        option to the client. Use "s46-cont-mapt" or "s46-cont-lw" for the
        MAP-T Container and S46 Lightweight 4over6 Container options
        respectively.
      </p><p>
        All remaining softwire options described below are included in one
        of the container options. Thus, they have to be included in appropriate
        option spaces by selecting a "space" name, which specifies in which
        option they are supposed to be included.

      Assume that we want to define a new DHCPv6 option called "foo" which will have
      code 100 and which will convey a single unsigned 32 bit integer value. We can define
      such an option by using the following commands:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "foo",
            "code": 100,
            "type": "uint32",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "",

            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }, ...
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The "false" value of the <span class="command"><strong>array</strong></span> parameter determines that the option does
      NOT comprise an array of "uint32" values but rather a single value.  Two
      other parameters have been left blank: <span class="command"><strong>record-types</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span>.
      The former specifies the comma separated list of option data fields if the
      option comprises a record of data fields. The <span class="command"><strong>record-types</strong></span> value should
      be non-empty if the <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> is set to "record". Otherwise it must be left
      blank. The latter parameter specifies the name of the option space being
      encapsulated by the particular option. If the particular option does not
      encapsulate any option space it should be left blank.  Note that the above
      example only defines the format of the new option, it does not set its
      value(s).
      </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>code</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> parameters are required, all others are
      optional. The <span class="command"><strong>array</strong></span> default value is
      <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span>. The <span class="command"><strong>record-types</strong></span>
      and <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span> default values are blank
      (i.e. ""). The default <span class="command"><strong>space</strong></span> is "dhcp6".
      </p><p>Once the new option format is defined, its value is set
      in the same way as for a standard option. For example the following
      commands set a global value that applies to all subnets.
</p><pre class="screen">

      </p><p>New options can take more complex forms than simple use of
      primitives (uint8, string, ipv6-address etc): it is possible to
      define an option comprising a number of existing primitives.
      </p><p>
      For example, assume we want to define a new option that will consist of an IPv6
      address, followed by an unsigned 16 bit integer, followed by a
      boolean value, followed by a text string. Such an option could
      be defined in the following way:
</p><pre class="screen">

            "array": false,
            "record-types": "ipv6-address, uint16, boolean, string",
            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }, ...
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The "type" is set to "record" to indicate that the option contains
      multiple values of different types.  These types are given as a comma-separated
      list in the "record-types" field and should be those listed in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp-types" title="TableÂ 8.2.Â List of standard DHCP option types">TableÂ 8.2, âList of standard DHCP option typesâ</a>.
      </p><p>
      The values of the option are set as follows:

        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>

      <span class="command"><strong>csv-format</strong></span> is set <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> to indicate
      that the <span class="command"><strong>data</strong></span> field comprises a command-separated list
      of values.  The values in the "data" must correspond to the types set in
      the "record-types" field of the option definition.
      </p><p>
      When <span class="command"><strong>array</strong></span> is set to <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span>
      and <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> is set to "record", the last field
      is an array, i.e., it can contain more than one value as in:

      Currently there are two option spaces defined for the DHCPv6
      daemon: "dhcp6" (for top level DHCPv6 options) and "vendor-opts-space",
      which is empty by default, but in which options can be defined.
      Those options will be carried in the Vendor-Specific
      Information option (code 17). The following examples show how to
      define an option "foo" with code 1 that consists of an IPv6 address,
      an unsigned 16 bit integer and a string. The "foo" option is
      conveyed in a Vendor-Specific Information option. This option
      comprises a single uint32 value that is set to "12345".
      The sub-option "foo" follows the data field holding this value.
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {

        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
     (Note that the option space is set to <span class="command"><strong>vendor-opts-space</strong></span>.)
     Once the option format is defined, the next step is to define actual values
     for that option:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {

        },
        ...
    ],

    We should also define a value (enterprise-number) for the

      conflict with standard DHCPv6 options, so a separate option
      space must be defined.
      </p><p>Note that it is not required to create a new option space when
      defining sub-options for a standard option because it is

      Assume that we want to have a DHCPv6 option called "container"

    Note that we have defined the options to belong to a new option space

    data in sub-options.
    </p><p>

</pre><p>
    </p><p>Note that it is possible to create an option which carries some data
    in addition to the sub-options defined in the encapsulated option space.
    For example, if the "container" option from the previous example was
    required to carry an uint16 value as well as the sub-options, the "type"
    value would have to be set to "uint16" in the option definition. (Such an
    option would then have the following data structure: DHCP header, uint16
    value, sub-options.) The value specified with the "data" parameter â which
    should be a valid integer enclosed in quotes, e.g. "123" â would then be
    assigned to the uint16 field in the "container" option.

      an option configuration and the default values can be used. However, it is
      important to understand the implications of not specifying some of them
      as it may result in configuration errors. The list below explains
      the behavior of the server when a particular parameter is not explicitly
      specified:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> - the server requires an option name or

          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>code</strong></span> - the server requires an option name or
          option code to identify an option. This parameter may be left unspecified if
          the <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> parameter is specified. However, this also
          requires that the particular option has its definition (it is either a
          standard option or an administrator created a definition for the option
          using an 'option-def' structure), as the option definition associates an
          option with a particular name. It is possible to configure an option
          for which there is no definition (unspecified option format).
          Configuration of such options requires the use of option code.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>space</strong></span> - if the option space is unspecified it

          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>data</strong></span> - if the option data is unspecified it
          defaults to an empty value. The empty value is mostly used for the
          options which have no payload (boolean options), but it is legal to specify
          empty values for some options which carry variable length data and which
          spec allows for the length of 0. For such options, the data parameter
          may be omitted in the configuration.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>csv-format</strong></span> - if this value is not
          specified the server will assume that the option data is specified as
          a list of comma separated values to be assigned to individual fields
          of the DHCP option. This behavior has changed in Kea 1.2. Older
          versions used additional logic to determine whether the csv-format
          should be true or false. That is no longer the case.

        The DHCPv6 server may receive requests from local (connected to the
        same subnet as the server) and remote (connecting via relays) clients.
        As the server may have many subnet configurations defined, it must select
        an appropriate subnet for a given request.
      </p><p>
        The server can not assume which of the configured subnets are local. In IPv4
        it is possible as there is a reasonable expectation that the
        server will have a (global) IPv4 address configured on the interface,
        and can use that information to detect whether a subnet is local or
        not. That assumption is not true in IPv6: the DHCPv6 server must be able
        to operate while only using link-local addresses. Therefore an optional
        <span class="command"><strong>interface</strong></span> parameter is available within a subnet definition
        to designate that a given subnet is local, i.e. reachable directly over
        the specified interface. For example the server that is intended to serve
        a local subnet over eth0 may be configured as follows:
        </p><pre class="screen">

        all subnets. It can be enabled for a particular subnet using the

          This setting only affects the subnet for which the
          <span class="command"><strong>rapid-commit</strong></span> is set to <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span>.
          For clients connected to other subnets, the server will ignore the
          Rapid Commit option sent by the client and will follow the 4-way
          exchange procedure, i.e. respond with an Advertise for a Solicit
          containing a Rapid Commit option.

          A DHCPv6 server with multiple subnets defined must select the
          appropriate subnet when it receives a request from a client.  For clients
          connected via relays, two mechanisms are used:
        </p><p>
          The first uses the linkaddr field in the RELAY_FORW message. The name
          of this field is somewhat misleading in that it does not contain a link-layer
          address: instead, it holds an address (typically a global address) that is
          used to identify a link. The DHCPv6 server checks if the address belongs
          to a defined subnet and, if it does, that subnet is selected for the client's
          request.
        </p><p>
          The second mechanism is based on interface-id options. While forwarding a client's
          message, relays may insert an interface-id option into the message that
          identifies the interface on the relay that received the message. (Some
          relays allow configuration of that parameter, but it is sometimes
          hardcoded and may range from the very simple (e.g. "vlan100") to the very cryptic:
          one example seen on real hardware was "ISAM144|299|ipv6|nt:vp:1:110"). The
          server can use this information to select the appropriate subnet.
          The information is also returned to the relay which then knows the
          interface to use to transmit the response to the client. In order for
          this to work successfully, the relay interface IDs must be unique within
          the network and the server configuration must match those values.
        </p><p>
          When configuring the DHCPv6 server, it should be noted that two
          similarly-named parameters can be configured for a subnet:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
              <span class="command"><strong>interface</strong></span> defines which local network interface can be used
              to access a given subnet.
            </li><li class="listitem">
              <span class="command"><strong>interface-id</strong></span> specifies the content of the interface-id option
              used by relays to identify the interface on the relay to which
              the response packet is sent.
            </li></ul></div><p>
          The two are mutually exclusive: a subnet cannot be both reachable locally
          (direct traffic) and via relays (remote traffic). Specifying both is a
          configuration error and the DHCPv6 server will refuse such a configuration.
        </p><p>
          The following example configuration shows how to specify an interface-id with
          a value of "vlan123".
          </p><pre class="screen">

      defines a mechanism called Relay-Supplied DHCP Options. In certain cases relay
      agents are the only entities that may have specific information. They can
      insert options when relaying messages from the client to the server. The
      server will then do certain checks and copy those options to the response
      that will be sent to the client.</p><p>There are certain conditions that must be met for the option to be
      included. First, the server must not provide the option itself. In
      other words, if both relay and server provide an option, the server always
      takes precedence. Second, the option must be RSOO-enabled. IANA maintains a
      list of RSOO-enabled options <a class="ulink" href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xhtml#options-relay-supplied" target="_top">here</a>.
      However, there may be cases when system administrators want to echo other
      options. Kea can be instructed to treat other options as RSOO-enabled.
      For example, to mark options 110, 120 and 130 as RSOO-enabled, the following
      syntax should be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"relay-supplied-options": [ "110", "120", "130" ],</code></strong>
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      </p><p>As of March 2015, only option 65 is RSOO-enabled by IANA. This
      option will always be treated as such and there's no need to explicitly
      mark it. Also, when enabling standard options, it is possible to use their
      names, rather than option code, e.g. (e.g. use
      <span class="command"><strong>dns-servers</strong></span> instead of <span class="command"><strong>23</strong></span>). See
      <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-std-options-list" title="TableÂ 9.1.Â List of Standard DHCPv6 Options">TableÂ 9.1, âList of Standard DHCPv6 Optionsâ</a> for the names. In certain cases
      it could also work for custom options, but due to the nature of the parser
      code this may be unreliable and should be avoided.

      The DHCPv6 server includes support for client classification.  For a deeper
      discussion of the classification process see <a class="xref" href="#classify" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Client Classification">ChapterÂ 13, <i>Client Classification</i></a>.
      </p><p>In certain cases it is useful to configure the server to differentiate between
      DHCP clients types and treat them accordingly. It is envisaged that client
      classification will be used for modifying the behavior of almost any part of
      the DHCP message processing. In the current release of Kea, there are three
      mechanisms that take advantage of the client classification in DHCPv6: subnet
      selection, address pool selection and DHCP options assignment.
      </p><p>
      In certain cases it is useful to differentiate between different types
      of clients and treat them accordingly. It is envisaged that client
      classification will be used for changing the behavior of almost any part of
      the DHCP message processing. In the current release of the software however,
      there are only some mechanisms that take advantage of client classification:
      subnet selection, pool selection, and assignment of different options.
      </p><p>
      Kea can be instructed to limit access to given subnets based on class information.
      This is particularly useful for cases where two types of devices share the
      same link and are expected to be served from two different subnets. The
      primary use case for such a scenario is cable networks. Here, there are two
      classes of devices: the cable modem itself, which should be handed a lease
      from subnet A and all other devices behind the modem that should get a lease
      from subnet B. That segregation is essential to prevent overly curious
      users from playing with their cable modems. For details on how to set up
      class restrictions on subnets, see <a class="xref" href="#classification-subnets" title="13.6.Â Configuring Subnets With Class Information">SectionÂ 13.6, âConfiguring Subnets With Class Informationâ</a>.
      </p><p>
      When subnets belong to a shared network the classification applies
      to subnet selection but not to pools, e.g., a pool in a subnet
      limited to a particular class can still be used by clients which do not
      belong to the class if the pool they are expected to use is exhausted.
      So the limit access based on class information is also available
      at the address/prefix pool level, see <a class="xref" href="#classification-pools" title="13.7.Â Configuring Pools With Class Information">SectionÂ 13.7, âConfiguring Pools With Class Informationâ</a> within a subnet.
      This is useful when to segregate clients belonging to the same subnet
      into different address ranges.
      </p><p>
      The process of doing classification is conducted in several steps. The first step
      is to assess an incoming packet and assign it to zero or more classes.  The
      second step is to choose a subnet, possibly based on the class information.
      The third step is to assign classes from host reservations and
      evaluate class expressions depending on the "KNOWN" class.
      After the list of required classes is built and each class of the list
      has its expression evaluated: when it returns true the packet is added
      as a member of the class.
      The last step is to assign options again possibly based on the class
      information.
      More complete and detailed description is available in
      <a class="xref" href="#classify" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Client Classification">ChapterÂ 13, <i>Client Classification</i></a>.
      </p><p>
      There are two main methods of doing classification. The first is automatic and relies
      on examining the values in the vendor class options or existence of a
      host reservation. Information from these
      options is extracted and a class name is constructed from it and added to
      the class list for the packet. The second allows for specifying an expression
      that is evaluated for each packet. If the result is true the packet is
      a member of the class.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        Care should be taken with client classification as it is easy for
        clients that do not meet class criteria to be denied any service altogether.

        The following example shows how to configure a class using an expression
        and a subnet making use of that class. This configuration defines the
        class named "Client_enterprise". It is comprised
        of all clients whose client identifiers start with the given hex string (which
        would indicate a DUID based on an enterprise id of 0xAABBCCDD).
        They will be given an address from 2001:db8:1::0 to 2001:db8:1::FFFF and
        the addresses of their DNS servers set to 2001:db8:0::1 and 2001:db8:2::1.

        In some cases it is useful to limit the scope of a class to
        a shared-network, subnet or pool. There are two parameters
        which are used to limit the scope of the class by instructing
        the server to perform evaluation of test expressions when
        required.
        </p><p>
        The first one is the per-class <span class="command"><strong>only-if-required</strong></span>
        flag which is false by default. When it is set to
        <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> the test expression of the class is not
        evaluated at the reception of the incoming packet but later and
        only if the class evaluation is required.
        </p><p>
        The second is the <span class="command"><strong>require-client-classes</strong></span> which
        takes a list of class names and is valid in shared-network,
        subnet and pool scope. Classes in these lists are marked as
        required and evaluated after selection of this specific
        shared-network/subnet/pool and before output option processing.
        </p><p>

        when the specified subnet is used.

         Required evaluation can be used to express complex dependencies,
         for example, subnet membership. It can also be used to reverse the
         precedence: if you set an option-data in a subnet it takes
         precedence over an option-data in a class. When you move the
         option-data to a required class and require it in
         the subnet, a class evaluated earlier may take precedence.
         </p><p>
         Required evaluation is also available at shared-network and
         pool/pd-pool levels. The order in which required classes are
         considered is: shared-network, subnet and (pd-)pool, i.e.
         the opposite order option-data are processed.

      As mentioned earlier, kea-dhcp6 can be configured to generate requests to
      the DHCP-DDNS server (referred to here as "D2") to update
      DNS entries.  These requests are known as NameChangeRequests or NCRs.
      Each NCR contains the following information:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
      Whether it is a request to add (update) or remove DNS entries
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Whether the change requests forward DNS updates (AAAA records), reverse
      DNS updates (PTR records), or both.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      The FQDN, lease address, and DHCID
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      The parameters controlling the generation of NCRs for submission to D2
      are contained in the <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-ddns</strong></span> section of the kea-dhcp6
      configuration. The mandatory parameters for the DHCP DDNS configuration
      are <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span> which is unconditionally
      required, and <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> which has no
      default value and is required when <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span>
      is set to <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span>.

      The two (disabled and enabled) minimal DHCP DDNS configurations are:

      In order for NCRs to reach the D2 server, kea-dhcp6 must be able
      to communicate with it.  kea-dhcp6 uses the following configuration
      parameters to control this communication:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span> - determines whether or not kea-dhcp6 will
      generate NCRs.  If missing, this value is assumed to be false hence DDNS updates
      are disabled.  To enable DDNS updates set this value to true:
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>server-ip</strong></span> - IP address on which D2 listens for requests. The default is
      the local loopback interface at address 127.0.0.1. You may specify
      either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>server-port</strong></span> - port on which D2 listens for requests.  The default value

      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>sender-ip</strong></span> - IP address which kea-dhcp6 should use to send requests to D2.
      The default value is blank which instructs kea-dhcp6 to select a suitable
      address.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>sender-port</strong></span> - port which kea-dhcp6 should use to send requests to D2. The
      default value of 0 instructs kea-dhcp6 to select a suitable port.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>max-queue-size</strong></span> - maximum number of requests allowed to queue waiting to
      be sent to D2. This value guards against requests accumulating
      uncontrollably if they are being generated faster than they can be
      delivered.  If the number of requests queued for transmission reaches
      this value, DDNS updating will be turned off until the queue backlog has
      been sufficiently reduced.  The intent is to allow kea-dhcp6 to
      continue lease operations.  The default value is 1024.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>ncr-protocol</strong></span> - socket protocol use when sending requests to D2.  Currently
      only UDP is supported.  TCP may be available in an upcoming release.

      By default, kea-dhcp-ddns is assumed to running on the same machine as kea-dhcp6, and
      all of the default values mentioned above should be sufficient.
      If, however, D2 has been configured to listen on a different address or
      port, these values must altered accordingly. For example, if D2 has been
      configured to listen on 2001:db8::5 port 900, the following configuration
      would be required:
</p><pre class="screen">

      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4704" target="_top">RFC 4704</a>.
      It is important to keep in mind that kea-dhcp6 provides the initial
      decision making of when and what to update and forwards that
      information to D2 in the form of NCRs. Carrying out the actual
      DNS updates and dealing with such things as conflict resolution
      are within the purview of D2 itself (<a class="xref" href="#dhcp-ddns-server" title="ChapterÂ 11.Â The DHCP-DDNS Server">ChapterÂ 11, <i>The DHCP-DDNS Server</i></a>).
      This section describes when kea-dhcp6 will generate NCRs and the
      configuration parameters that can be used to influence this decision.
      It assumes that the <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span> parameter is true.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        Currently the interface between kea-dhcp6 and D2 only supports requests
        which update DNS entries for a single IP address.  If a lease grants
        more than one address, kea-dhcp6 will create the DDNS update request for
        only the first of these addresses.  Support for multiple address
        mappings may be provided in a future release.
        </p></div><p>
      In general, kea-dhcp6 will generate DDNS update requests when:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
      A new lease is granted in response to a REQUEST
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      An existing lease is renewed but the FQDN associated with it has
      changed.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      An existing lease is released in response to a RELEASE
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      In the second case, lease renewal, two  DDNS requests will be issued: one
      request to remove entries for the previous FQDN and a second request to
      add entries for the new FQDN.  In the last case, a lease release, a
      single DDNS request to remove its entries will be made.
      </p><p>
      The decision making involved when granting a new lease the first case) is more
      involved. When a new lease is granted, kea-dhcp6 will generate a DDNS
      update request only if the REQUEST contains the FQDN option (code 39).
      By default kea-dhcp6 will respect the FQDN N and S flags specified by the client
      as shown in the following table:
      </p><div class="table"><a name="dhcp6-fqdn-flag-table"></a><p class="title"><b>TableÂ 9.3.Â Default FQDN Flag Behavior</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Default FQDN Flag Behavior" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left" class="cflags"><col align="left" class="meaning"><col align="left" class="response"><col align="left" class="sflags"></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Client Flags:N-S</th><th align="left">Client Intent</th><th align="left">Server Response</th><th align="left">Server Flags:N-S-O</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">0-0</td><td align="left">

      The first row in the table above represents "client delegation". Here
      the DHCP client states that it intends to do the forward DNS updates and
      the server should do the reverse updates.  By default, kea-dhcp6 will honor
      the client's wishes and generate a DDNS request to D2 to update only
      reverse DNS data.  The parameter, <span class="command"><strong>override-client-update</strong></span>, can be used
      to instruct the server to override client delegation requests.  When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp6 will disregard requests for client
      delegation and generate a DDNS request to update both forward and
      reverse DNS data.  In this case, the N-S-O flags in the server's
      response to the client will be 0-1-1 respectively.
      </p><p>
      (Note that the flag combination N=1, S=1 is prohibited according to
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4702" target="_top">RFC 4702</a>. If such a
      combination is received from the client, the packet will be dropped by kea-dhcp6.)
      </p><p>
      To override client delegation, set the following values in the configuration:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"override-client-update": true</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The third row in the table above describes the case in which the client
      requests that no DNS updates be done. The parameter, <span class="command"><strong>override-no-update</strong></span>,
      can be used to instruct the server to disregard the client's wishes. When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp6 will generate DDNS update requests to
      kea-dhcp-ddns even if the client requests no updates be done.  The N-S-O
      flags in the server's response to the client will be 0-1-1.
      </p><p>
      To override client delegation, issue the following commands:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {

      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
        If the DHCPREQUEST contains the client FQDN option, the candidate name

      </p></li></ol></div><p>
        These rules can amended by setting the

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>never</strong></span> - Use the name the client sent.  If the client

    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
    Note that formerly, this parameter was a boolean and permitted only values
    of <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span>.  Boolean values
    have been deprecated and are no longer accepted.  If you are currently using
    booleans, you must replace them with the desired mode name. A value of

    <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span> maps to <span class="command"><strong>"never"</strong></span>.
    </div><p>

      For example, To instruct kea-dhcp6 to always generate the FQDN for a
      client, set the parameter <span class="command"><strong>replace-client-name</strong></span> to
      <span class="command"><strong>always</strong></span> as follows:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"replace-client-name": "always"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The prefix used in the generation of an FQDN is specified by the
      <span class="command"><strong>generated-prefix</strong></span> parameter.  The default value is "myhost".  To alter
      its value, simply set it to the desired string:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"generated-prefix": "another.host"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The suffix used when generating an FQDN or when qualifying a
      partial name is specified by
      the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> parameter. This
      parameter has no default value, thus it is mandatory when
      DDNS updates are enabled.
      To set its value simply set it to the desired string:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"qualifying-suffix": "foo.example.org"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre></div><p>
      When qualifying a partial name, kea-dhcp6 will construct a name with the
      format:
      </p><p>
        [candidate-name].[qualifying-suffix].
      </p><p>
      where candidate-name is the partial name supplied in the REQUEST.
      For example, if FQDN domain name value was "some-computer" and
      qualifying-suffix "example.com", the generated FQDN would be:
      </p><p>
        some-computer.example.com.
      </p><p>
      When generating the entire name, kea-dhcp6 will construct name of the
      format:
      </p><p>
        [generated-prefix]-[address-text].[qualifying-suffix].
      </p><p>
      where address-text is simply the lease IP address converted to a
      hyphenated string.  For example, if lease address is 3001:1::70E,
      the qualifying suffix "example.com", and the default value is used for
      <span class="command"><strong>generated-prefix</strong></span>, the generated FQDN would be:

      This section is about the configuration of the DHCPv6 side
      (the DHCPv4 side is described in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-dhcp4o6-config" title="8.2.20.Â DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6: DHCPv4 Side">SectionÂ 8.2.20, âDHCPv4-over-DHCPv6: DHCPv4 Sideâ</a>).

    a per host basis. The most obvious one is to reserve specific, static IPv6
    address or/and prefix for exclusive use by a given client (host) â returning
    client will get the same address or/and prefix every time and other clients will
    never get that address. Note that there may be cases when the
    new reservation has been made for the client for the address or prefix being
    currently in use by another client. We call this situation a "conflict". The
    conflicts get resolved automatically over time as described in the subsequent
    sections. Once conflict is resolved, the client will keep receiving the reserved
    configuration when it renews.</p><p>Another example when the host reservations are applicable is when a host
    has specific requirements, e.g. a printer that needs additional DHCP options
    or a cable modem needs specific parameters. Yet another possible use case for
    host reservation is to define unique names for hosts.</p><p>Hosts reservations are defined as parameters for each subnet. Each host
    can be identified by either DUID or its hardware/MAC address. See
    <a class="xref" href="#mac-in-dhcpv6" title="9.10.Â MAC/Hardware Addresses in DHCPv6">SectionÂ 9.10, âMAC/Hardware Addresses in DHCPv6â</a> for details. There is an optional
    <span class="command"><strong>reservations</strong></span> array in the
    <span class="command"><strong>subnet6</strong></span> structure. Each element in that array
    is a structure, that holds information about a single host. In
    particular, the structure has an identifier that
    uniquely identifies a host.  In the DHCPv6 context, such an identifier
    is usually a DUID, but can also be a hardware or MAC address.  Also,
    either one or more addresses or prefixes may be specified. It is
    possible to specify a hostname and DHCPv6 options for a given host.</p><p>The following example shows how to reserve addresses and prefixes
    for specific hosts:

    This example includes reservations for three different clients. The first reservation
    is made for the address 2001:db8:1::100 for a client using DUID
    01:02:03:04:05:0A:0B:0C:0D:0E. The second reservation is made for two addresses
    2001:db8:1::101 and 2001:db8:1::102 for a client using MAC address
    00:01:02:03:04:05. Lastly, address 2001:db8:1::103 and prefix 2001:db8:2:abcd::/64
    are reserved for a client using DUID 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0A. The
    last reservation also assigns a hostname to this client.
    </p><p>Note that DHCPv6 allows for a single client to lease multiple addresses
    and multiple prefixes at the same time. Therefore <span class="command"><strong>ip-addresses</strong></span>
    and <span class="command"><strong>prefixes</strong></span> are plural and are actually arrays.
    When the client sends multiple IA options (IA_NA or IA_PD), each reserved
    address or prefix is assigned to an individual IA of the appropriate type. If
    the number of IAs of specific type is lower than the number of reservations
    of that type, the number of reserved addresses or prefixes assigned to the
    client is equal to the number of IA_NAs or IA_PDs sent by the client, i.e.
    some reserved addresses or prefixes are not assigned. However,
    they still remain reserved for this client and the server will not assign
    them to any other client. If the number of IAs of specific type sent by the
    client is greater than the number of reserved addresses or prefixes, the
    server will try to assign all reserved addresses or prefixes to the individual
    IAs and dynamically allocate addresses or prefixes to remaining IAs. If the
    server cannot assign a reserved address or prefix because it is in use,
    the server will select the next reserved address or prefix and try to assign it to
    the client. If the server subsequently finds that there are no more reservations
    that can be assigned to the client at the moment, the server will try to
    assign leases dynamically.
    </p><p>Making a reservation for a mobile host that may visit multiple subnets
    requires a separate host definition in each subnet it is expected to visit.
    It is not allowed to define multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address in a single subnet. Multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address are valid if each is in a different subnet.  The reservation for a given host
    should include only one identifier, either DUID or hardware address. Defining
    both for the same host is considered a configuration error, but as of 1.1.0,
    it is not rejected.
    </p><p>Adding host reservation incurs a performance penalty. In principle,
    when a server that does not support host reservation responds to a query,
    it needs to check whether there is a lease for a given address being
    considered for allocation or renewal. The server that also supports host
    reservation, has to perform additional checks: not only if the address is
    currently used (i.e. if there is a lease for it), but also whether the address
    could be used by someone else (i.e. if there is a reservation for it). That
    additional check incurs additional overhead.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation6-types"></a>9.3.1.Â Address/Prefix Reservation Types</h3></div></div></div><p>In a typical scenario there is an IPv6 subnet defined with a certain
      part of it dedicated for dynamic address allocation by the DHCPv6
      server. There may be an additional address space defined for prefix
      delegation. Those dynamic parts are referred to as dynamic pools, address
      and prefix pools or simply pools. In principle, the host reservation can
      reserve any address or prefix that belongs to the subnet. The reservations
      that specify an address that belongs to configured pools are called
      "in-pool reservations". In contrast, those that do not
      belong to dynamic pools are called "out-of-pool
      reservations". There is no formal difference in the reservation
      syntax and both reservation types are handled
      uniformly. However, upcoming releases may offer improved performance if
      there are only out-of-pool reservations as the server will be able to skip
      reservation checks when dealing with existing leases. Therefore, system
      administrators are encouraged to use out-of-pool reservations if
      possible.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation6-conflict"></a>9.3.2.Â Conflicts in DHCPv6 Reservations</h3></div></div></div><p>As reservations and lease information are stored separately,
      conflicts may arise. Consider the following series of events. The server
      has configured the dynamic pool of addresses from the range of 2001:db8::10
      to 2001:db8::20. Host A requests an address and gets 2001:db8::10. Now the
      system administrator decides to reserve address 2001:db8::10 for Host B.
      In general, reserving an address
      that is currently assigned to someone else is not recommended, but there
      are valid use cases where such an operation is warranted.</p><p>The server now has a conflict to resolve. Let's analyze the
      situation here. If Host B boots up and request an address, the server is
      not able to assign the reserved address 2001:db8::10. A naive approach
      would to be immediately remove the lease for Host A and create a new one
      for Host B. That would not solve the problem, though, because as soon as
      Host B get the address, it will detect that the address is already in use
      by someone else (Host A) and would send a Decline message. Therefore in this
      situation, the server has to temporarily assign a different address from the
      dynamic pool (not matching what has been reserved) to Host B.</p><p>When Host A renews its address, the server will discover that
      the address being renewed is now reserved for someone else (Host
      B). Therefore the server will remove the lease for 2001:db8::10, select
      a new address and create a new lease for it. It will send two
      addresses in its response: the old address with lifetime set to 0 to
      explicitly indicate that it is no longer valid and the new address with a
      non-zero lifetime. When Host B renews its temporarily assigned
      address, the server will detect that the existing lease does not match
      reservation, so it will release the current address Host B has and will
      create a new lease matching the reservation. Similar as before, the server
      will send two addresses: the temporarily assigned one with zeroed
      lifetimes, and the new one that matches reservation with proper lifetimes
      set.</p><p>This recovery will succeed, even if other hosts will attempt to get
      the reserved address. Had Host C requested address 2001:db8::10 after
      the reservation was made, the server will propose a different address.</p><p>This recovery mechanism allows the server to fully recover from a
      case where reservations conflict with existing leases. This procedure
      takes time and will roughly take as long as renew-timer value specified.
      The best way to avoid such recovery is to not define new reservations that
      conflict with existing leases. Another recommendation is to use
      out-of-pool reservations. If the reserved address does not belong to a
      pool, there is no way that other clients could get this address.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation6-hostname"></a>9.3.3.Â Reserving a Hostname</h3></div></div></div><p>When the reservation for the client includes the <span class="command"><strong>hostname</strong></span>,
      the server will assign this hostname to the client and send
      it back in the Client FQDN, if the client sent the FQDN option to the
      server. The reserved hostname always takes precedence over the hostname
       supplied by the client (via the FQDN option) or the autogenerated
      (from the IPv6 address) hostname.</p><p>The server qualifies the reserved hostname with the value
      of the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> parameter. For example, the
      following subnet configuration:
</p><pre class="screen">

      </strong></span> is not specified, the default (empty) value will be used, and
      in this case the value specified as a <span class="command"><strong>hostname</strong></span> will
      be treated as fully qualified name.  Thus, by leaving the
      <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> empty it is possible to qualify
      hostnames for the different clients with different domain names:

      allocation engine (the component of Kea that selects an address for a client)
      during lease selection and renewal. In particular, three
      major checks are necessary. First, when selecting a new lease, it is not
      sufficient for a candidate lease to not be used by another DHCP client. It
      also must not be reserved for another client. Second, when renewing a lease,
      additional check must be performed whether the address being renewed is not
      reserved for another client. Finally, when a host renews an address or a
      prefix, the server has to check whether there is a reservation for this host,
      so the existing (dynamically allocated) address should be revoked and the
      reserved one be used instead.</p><p>Some of those checks may be unnecessary in certain deployments and not
      performing them may improve performance. The Kea server provides the
      <span class="command"><strong>reservation-mode</strong></span> configuration parameter to select the
      types of reservations allowed for the particular subnet. Each reservation
      type has different constraints for the checks to be performed by the
      server when allocating or renewing a lease for the client.
      Allowed values are:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"> <span class="command"><strong>all</strong></span> - enables all host reservation
      types. This is the default value. This setting is the safest and the most
      flexible. It allows in-pool and out-of-pool reservations. As all checks
      are conducted, it is also the slowest.
      </li><li class="listitem"> <span class="command"><strong>out-of-pool</strong></span> - allows only out of
      pool host reservations.  With this setting in place, the server may assume
      that all host reservations are for addresses that do not belong to the
      dynamic pool. Therefore it can skip the reservation checks when dealing
      with in-pool addresses, thus improving performance. Do not use this mode
      if any of your reservations use in-pool address. Caution is advised when
      using this setting. Kea does not sanity check the reservations against
      <span class="command"><strong>reservation-mode</strong></span> and misconfiguration may cause problems.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>disabled</strong></span> - host reservation support is disabled. As there
      are no reservations, the server will skip all checks. Any reservations defined

      operate faster in this mode.

      </p><p>Another aspect of the host reservations are different types of
      identifiers. Kea 1.1.0 supports two types of identifiers
      in DHCPv6: hw-address and duid, but more identifier types
      are likely to be added in the future. This is beneficial from a
      usability perspective. However, there is a drawback. For each incoming
      packet Kea has to to extract each identifier type and then query the
      database to see if there is a reservation done by this particular
      identifier. If nothing is found, the next identifier is extracted and next
      query is issued. This process continues until either a reservation is
      found or all identifier types have been checked. Over time with an increasing
      number of supported identifier types, Kea would become slower and
      slower.</p><p>To address this problem, a parameter called
      <span class="command"><strong>host-reservation-identifiers</strong></span> has been introduced. It
      takes a list of identifier types as a parameter. Kea will check only those
      identifier types enumerated in host-reservation-identifiers. From a
      performance perspective the number of identifier types should be kept to
      minimum, ideally limited to one. If your deployment uses several
      reservation types, please enumerate them from most to least frequently
      used as this increases the chances of Kea finding the reservation using the
      fewest number of queries. An example of host reservation identifiers looks
      as follows:

</p><pre class="screen">

    to determine the point of attachment, or simply put, where the client is
    connected to the network. Second, the subnet information is used to group
    information pertaining to specific location in the network. This approach
    works well in general case, but the are scenarios where the boundaries are
    blurred. Sometimes it is useful to have more than one logical IP subnet
    being deployed on the same physical link. The need to understand
    that two or more subnets are used on the same link requires additional logic
    in the DHCP server. This capability has been added in Kea 1.3.0.  It is
    called "shared networks" in Kea and ISC DHCP projects. It is sometimes also
    called "shared subnets". In Microsoft's nomenclature it is called "multinet".
    </p><p>There are many use cases where the feature is useful. The most common
    example in the IPv4 case is when the server is running out of available
    addresses in a subnet. This is less common in IPv6, but the shared networks
    are still useful in IPv6. One of the use cases is an exhaustion of IPv6
    delegated prefixes within a subnet. Another IPv6 specific example
    is an experiment with addressing scheme. With the advent of IPv6 deployment
    and vast address space, many organizations split the address space into
    subnets, then deploy it and after a while discover that they want to split it
    differently. In the transition period they want both old and new addressing
    to be available. Thus the need for more than one subnet on the same physical
    link.</p><p>Finally, the case of cable networks is directly applicable in
    IPv6. There are two types of devices in cable networks: cable modems and the
    end user devices behind them. It is a common practice to use different
    subnet for cable modems to prevent users from tinkering with their cable
    modems. In this case, the distinction is based on the type of device, rather
    than coming out of running out address space.</p><p>A client connected to a shared network may be assigned a lease (address
    or prefix) from any of the pools defined within the subnets belonging to the
    shared network. Internally, the server selects one of the subnets belonging to the
    shared network and tries to allocate a lease from this subnet. If the
    server is unable to allocate a lease from the selected subnet (e.g. due
    to pools exhaustion) it will use another subnet from the same shared
    network and try to allocate a lease from this subnet etc. Therefore, in the
    typical case, the server will allocate all leases available in a given
    subnet before it starts allocating leases from other subnets belonging to
    the same shared network. However, in certain situations the client can be
    allocated a lease from the other subnets before the pools in the first
    subnet get exhausted, e.g. when the client provides a hint that belongs
    to another subnet or the client has reservations in a different than
    default subnet.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>It is strongly discouraged for the Kea deployments to assume that the
      server doesn't allocate leases from other subnets until it uses all
      the leases from the first subnet in the shared network. Apart from the
      fact that hints, host reservations and client classification affect subnet
      selection, it is also foreseen that we will enhance allocation strategies
      for shared networks in the future versions of Kea, so as the selection
      of subnets within a shared network is equally probable (unpredictable).</p></div><p>In order to define a shared network an additional configuration scope

    </p><p>As you see in the example, it is possible to mix shared and regular
    ("plain") subnets. Each shared network must have a unique name. This is a
    similar concept to ID for subnets, but it offers more flexibility. This is used
    for logging, but also internally for identifying shared networks.</p><p>In principle it makes sense to define only shared networks that
    consist of two or more subnets. However, for testing purposes it is allowed
    to define a shared network with just one subnet or even an empty one.  This
    is not a recommended practice in production networks, as the shared network
    logic requires additional processing and thus lowers server's performance.
    To avoid unnecessary performance degradation the shared subnets should only
    be defined when required by the deployment.
    </p><p>Shared networks provide an ability to specify many parameters in
    the shared network scope that will apply to all subnets within it. If
    necessary, you can specify a parameter in the shared network scope and then
    override its value on the subnet scope. For example:

    In this example, there is a dns-servers option defined that is available to
    clients in both subnets in this shared network. Also, a valid lifetime is
    set to 10 minutes (600s). However, the first subnet overrides some of the values
    (valid lifetime is 20 minutes, different IP address for dns-servers), but
    also adds its own option (unicast address). Assuming a client asking for a
    server unicast and dns servers options is assigned a lease from this subnet,
    he will get a lease for 20 minutes and dns-servers and be allowed to use
    server unicast at address 2001:abcd::1. If the same client is assigned to
    the second subnet, he will get a 10 minutes long lease, dns-servers value of
    2001:db8:cafe::1 and no server unicast.

</p><p>Somewhat similar to interface names, also relay IP addresses can be
specified for the whole shared network. However, depending on your relay
configuration, it may use different IP addresses depending on which subnet
is being used. Thus there is no requirement to use the same IP relay address
for each subnet. Here's an example:

In this particular case the relay IP address specified on network level doesn't
have much sense, as it is overridden in both subnets, but it was left there
as an example of how one could be defined on network level. Note that the
relay agent IP address typically belongs to the subnet it relays packets from,
but this is not a strict requirement. Therefore Kea accepts any value here
as long as it is valid IPv6 address.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp57802400"></a>9.4.2.Â Client classification in shared networks</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes it is desired to segregate clients into specific subnets
      based on some properties. This mechanism is called client classification
      and is described in <a class="xref" href="#classify" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Client Classification">ChapterÂ 13, <i>Client Classification</i></a>. Client classification
      can be applied to subnets belonging to shared networks in the same way
      as it is used for subnets specified outside of shared networks.
      It is important to understand how the server selects subnets for
      the clients when client classification is in use, to assure that the
      desired subnet is selected for a given client type.</p><p>If a subnet is associated with some classes, only the clients
      belonging to any of these classes can use this subnet. If there are no
      classes specified for a subnet, any client connected to a given shared
      network can use this subnet. A common mistake is to assume that the
      subnet including client classes is preferred over subnets without
      client classes. Consider the following example:

</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "client-classes": [
        {
            "name": "b-devices",
            "test": "option[1234].hex == 0x0002"
        }
    ],
    "shared-networks": [
        {
            "name": "galah",
            "relay": {
                "ip-address": [ "2001:db8:2:34::1" ]
            },
            "subnet6": [
                {
                    "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
                    "pools": [ { "pool": "2001:db8:1::20 - 2001:db8:1::ff" } ],
                },
                {
                    "subnet": "2001:db8:3::/64",
                    "pools": [ { "pool": "2001:db8:3::20 - 2001:db8:3::ff" } ],
                    <strong class="userinput"><code>"client-class": "b-devices"</code></strong>
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>

        If the client belongs to "b-devices" class (because it includes option
        1234 with a value of 0x0002) it doesn't guarantee that the subnet 2001:db8:3::/64
        will be used (or preferred) for this client. The server can use any of
        the two subnets because the subnet 2001:db8:1::/64 is also allowed for
        this client. The client classification used in this case should be pereceived
        as a way to restrict access to certain subnets, rather than a way to express
        subnet preference. For example, if the client doesn't belong to the
        "b-devices" class it may only use the subnet 2001:db8:1::/64 and will
        never use the subnet 2001:db8:3::/64.
      </p><p>A typical use case for client classification is in the cable network,
      where cable modems should use one subnet and other devices should use
      another subnet within the same shared network. In this case it is required
      to apply classification on all subnets. The following example defines two
      classes of devices. The subnet selection is made based on option 1234 values.
</p><pre class="screen">

    "client-classes": [

        {

                {
                    "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",

            ]
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
In this example each class has its own restriction. Only clients that belong to
class a-devices will be able to use subnet 2001:db8:1::/64 and only clients
belonging to b-devices will be able to use subnet 2001:db8:3::/64. Care should
be taken to not define too restrictive classification rules, as clients that are
unable to use any subnets will be refused service. Although, this may be
desired outcome if one desires to service only clients of known properties
(e.g. only VoIP phones allowed on a given link).</p><p>
      Note that it is possible to achieve similar effect as presented in this
      section without the use of shared networks. If the subnets are placed in
      the global subnets scope, rather than in the shared network, the server
      will still use classification rules to pick the right subnet for a given
      class of devices. The major benefit of placing subnets within the
      shared network is that common parameters for the logically grouped
      subnets can be specified once, in the shared network scope, e.g.
      "interface" or "relay" parameter. All subnets belonging to this shared
      network will inherit those parameters.

</p><p>It is worth noting that Kea conducts additional checks when processing a
packet if shared networks are defined. First, instead of simply checking if
there's a reservation for a given client in his initially selected subnet, it
goes through all subnets in a shared network looking for a reservation. This is
one of the reasons why defining a shared network may impact performance. If
there is a reservation for a client in any subnet, that particular subnet will
be picked for the client. Although it's technically not an error, it is
considered a bad practice to define reservations for the same host in multiple
subnets belonging to the same shared network.</p><p>While not strictly mandatory, it is strongly recommended to use explicit
"id" values for subnets if you plan to use database storage for host
reservations. If ID is not specified, the values for it be autogenerated,
i.e. it will assign increasing integer values starting from 1. Thus, the
autogenerated IDs are not stable across configuration changes.

      as a DUID) for clients to be able to discriminate between several
      servers present on the same link.
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315" target="_top">RFC 3315</a>
      defines three DUID types: DUID-LLT, DUID-EN and DUID-LL.
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6355" target="_top">RFC 6355</a>
      also defines DUID-UUID. Future specifications may introduce new
      DUID types.</p><p>The Kea DHCPv6 server generates a server identifier once, upon
      the first startup, and stores it in a file. This identifier isn't
      modified across restarts of the server and so is a stable identifier.</p><p>Kea follows recommendation from
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315" target="_top">RFC 3315</a>
      to use DUID-LLT as the default server identifier. However, we have
      received reports that some deployments require different DUID
      types, and there is a need to administratively select both DUID
      type and/or its contents.</p><p>The server identifier can be configured using parameters
      within the <span class="command"><strong>server-id</strong></span> map element in the global
      scope of the Kea configuration file. The following example
      demonstrates how to select DUID-EN as a server identifier:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "server-id": {
        "type": "EN"
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>

      </p><p>Currently supported values for <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span>
      parameter are: "LLT", "EN" and "LL", for DUID-LLT, DUID-EN and
      DUID-LL respectively.</p><p>When a new DUID type is selected the server will generate its
      value and replace any existing DUID in the file. The server will then
      use the new server identifier in all future interactions with the
      clients.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If the new server identifier is created after some clients
      have obtained their leases, the clients using the old identifier will not
      be able to renew the leases: the server will ignore messages
      containing the old server identifier. Clients will continue sending
      Renew until they transition to the rebinding state. In this state they
      will start sending Rebind messages to multicast address without
      a server identifier. The server will respond to the Rebind messages
      with a new server identifier and the clients will associate the
      new server identifier with their leases. Although the clients will
      be able to keep their leases and will eventually learn the new server
      identifier, this will be at the cost of increased number of renewals
      and multicast traffic due to a need to rebind. Therefore it is
      recommended that modification of the server identifier type
      and value is avoided if the server has already assigned leases and these
      leases are still valid.</p></div><p>There are cases when an administrator needs to explicitly
      specify a DUID value rather than allow the server to generate it.
      The following example demonstrates how to explicitly set all
      components of a DUID-LLT.

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "server-id": {

        address, specified as a string of hexadecimal digits,</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>time</strong></span> is a 32-bit unsigned
        time value.</li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>The hexadecimal representation of the DUID generated as a result
      of the configuration specified above will be:
</p><pre class="screen">
 00:01:00:08:96:23:AB:E6:A6:5D:C7:41:0F:05
|type |htype|   time    |   identifier    |
</pre><p>
      </p><p>It is allowed to use special value of 0 for "htype" and "time",
      which indicates that the server should use ANY value for these
      components. If the server already uses a DUID-LLT it will use the
      values from this DUID. If the server uses a DUID of a different type
      or doesn't use any DUID yet, it will generate these values.
      Similarly, if the "identifier" is assigned an empty string, the
      value of the identifier will be generated. Omitting any of these
      parameters is equivalent to setting them to those special values.
      </p><p>For example, the following configuration:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "server-id": {
        "type": "LLT",
        "htype": 0,
        "identifier": "",
        "time": 2518920166
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>

      indicates that the server should use ANY link layer address and
      hardware type. If the server is already using DUID-LLT it will
      use the link layer address and hardware type from the existing DUID.
      If the server is not using any DUID yet, it will use link layer
      address and hardware type from one of the available network
      interfaces. The server will use an explicit value of time. If it
      is different than a time value present in the currently used
      DUID, that value will be replaced, effectively causing
      modification of the current server identifier.
      </p><p>
        The following example demonstrates an explicit configuration of
        a DUID-EN:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "server-id": {
        "type": "EN",
        "enterprise-id": 2495,
        "identifier": "87ABEF7A5BB545"

        unsigned value holding enterprise number,</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>identifier</strong></span> is a variable
        length identifier within DUID-EN.</li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
        The hexadecimal representation of the DUID-EN created according to
        the configuration above is:
</p><pre class="screen">
 00:02:00:00:09:BF:87:AB:EF:7A:5B:B5:45
|type |  ent-id   |     identifier     |
</pre><p>
      </p><p>As in the case of the DUID-LLT, special values can be used for the
      configuration of the DUID-EN. If <span class="command"><strong>enterprise-id</strong></span> is 0, the server
      will use a value from the existing DUID-EN. If the server is not using
      any DUID or the existing DUID has a different type, the ISC enterprise
      id will be used. When an empty string is used for <span class="command"><strong>identifier</strong></span>, the
      identifier from the existing DUID-EN will be used. If the server is
      not using any DUID-EN the new 6-bytes long identifier will be generated.
      </p><p>DUID-LL is configured in the same way as DUID-LLT with an exception
      that the <span class="command"><strong>time</strong></span> parameter has no effect for DUID-LL,
      because this DUID type only comprises a hardware type and link layer
      address. The following example demonstrates how to configure DUID-LL:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "server-id": {
        "type": "LL",
        "htype": 8,
        "identifier": "A65DC7410F05"
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>

      </p><p>
      which will result in the following server identifier:

</p><pre class="screen">
 00:03:00:08:A6:5D:C7:41:0F:05
|type |htype|   identifier    |
</pre><p>
      </p><p>The server stores the generated server identifier in the following
      location: [kea-install-dir]/var/kea/kea-dhcp6-serverid.
      </p><p>In some uncommon deployments where no stable storage is
      available, the server should be configured not to try to
      store the server identifier. This choice is controlled
      by the value of <span class="command"><strong>persist</strong></span> boolean parameter:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "server-id": {
        "type": "EN",
        "enterprise-id": 2495,

        "persist": false
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      </p><p>The default value of the "persist" parameter is
      <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> which configures the server to store the
      server identifier on a disk.</p><p>In the example above, the server is configured to not store
      the generated server identifier on a disk. But, if the server
      identifier is not modified in the configuration the same value
      will be used after server restart, because entire server
      identifier is explicitly specified in the configuration.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="stateless-dhcp6"></a>9.6.Â Stateless DHCPv6 (Information-Request Message)</h2></div></div></div><p>Typically DHCPv6 is used to assign both addresses and options. These
      assignments (leases) have state that changes over time, hence
      their name, stateful. DHCPv6 also supports a stateless mode,
      where clients request configuration options only. This mode is
      considered lightweight from the server perspective as it does not require
      any state tracking; hence its name.</p><p>The Kea server supports stateless mode. Clients can send
      Information-Request messages and the server will send back
      answers with the requested options (providing the options are
      available in the server configuration).  The server will attempt to
      use per-subnet options first. If that fails - for whatever reason - it
      will then try to provide options defined in the global scope.</p><p>Stateless and stateful mode can be used together. No special
      configuration directives are required to handle this. Simply use the
      configuration for stateful clients and the stateless clients will get
      just options they requested.</p><p>This usage of global options allows for an interesting case.
      It is possible to run a server that provides just options and no
      addresses or prefixes. If the options have the same value in each
      subnet, the configuration can define required options in the global
      scope and skip subnet definitions altogether. Here's a simple example of
      such a configuration:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ "ethX" ]

    } ]</code></strong>,
    "lease-database": { "type": "memfile" }
 }
</pre><p>
      This very simple configuration will provide DNS server information
      to all clients in the network, regardless of their location. Note the
      specification of the memfile lease database: this is needed as
      Kea requires a lease database to be specified
      even if it is not used.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dhcp6-rfc7550"></a>9.7.Â Support for RFC 7550</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7550" target="_top">RFC 7550</a>
      introduced some changes to the DHCPv6 protocol to resolve a few issues
      with the coexistence of multiple stateful options in the messages sent
      between the clients and servers.</p><p>The typical example is when the client, such as a requesting
      router, requests an allocation of both addresses and prefixes when
      it performs the 4-way (SARR) exchange with the server. If the
      server is not configured to allocate any prefixes but it can allocate
      some addresses, it will respond with the IA_NA(s) containing allocated
      addresses and the IA_PD(s) containing the NoPrefixAvail status code. If
      the client can operate without prefixes it may transition to the
      'bound' state when it sends Renew/Rebind messages to the server,
      according to the T1 and T2 times, to extend the lifetimes of the
      allocated addresses. If the client is still interested in obtaining
      prefixes from the server it may also include an IA_PD in the Renew/Rebind
      to request allocation of the prefixes. If the server still cannot
      allocate the prefixes, it will respond with the IA_PD(s) containing
      NoPrefixAvail status code. However, if the server can now allocate
      the prefixes it will do so, and send them in the IA_PD(s) to the client.
      Allocation of leases during the Renew/Rebind was not supported in the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315" target="_top">RFC 3315</a>
      and <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3633" target="_top">RFC 3633</a>,
      and has been introduced in
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7550" target="_top">RFC 7550</a>.
      Kea supports this new behavior and it doesn't provide any configuration
      mechanisms to disable it.

        The relay has to have an interface connected to the link on which
        the clients are being configured. Typically the relay has a global IPv6
        address configured on the interface that belongs to the subnet from which
        the server will assign addresses. In the typical case, the
        server is able to use the IPv6 address inserted by the relay (in the link-addr
        field in RELAY-FORW message) to select the appropriate subnet.
      </p><p>
        However, that is not always the case. The relay
        address may not match the subnet in certain deployments. This
        usually means that there is more than one subnet allocated for a given
        link. The two most common examples where this is the case are long lasting
        network renumbering (where both old and new address space is still being
        used) and a cable network. In a cable network both cable modems and the
        devices behind them are physically connected to the same link, yet
        they use distinct addressing. In such case, the DHCPv6 server needs
        additional information (like the value of interface-id option or IPv6
        address inserted in the link-addr field in RELAY-FORW message) to
        properly select an appropriate subnet.
      </p><p>
        The following example assumes that there is a subnet 2001:db8:1::/64
        that is accessible via a relay that uses 3000::1 as its IPv6 address.
        The server will be able to select this subnet for any incoming packets
        that came from a relay with an address in 2001:db8:1::/64 subnet.
        It will also select that subnet for a relay with address 3000::1.

      from the clients and administrators
      frequently use that information to perform certain tasks, like per host
      configuration, address reservation for specific MAC addresses and other.
      Unfortunately, the DHCPv6 protocol does not provide any completely reliable way
      to retrieve that information. To mitigate that issue a number of mechanisms
      have been implemented in Kea that attempt to gather it. Each
      of those mechanisms works in certain cases, but may fail in other cases.
      Whether the mechanism works or not in the particular deployment is
      somewhat dependent on the network topology and the technologies used.</p><p>Kea allows configuration of which of the supported methods should be
      used and in what order. This configuration may be considered a fine tuning
      of the DHCP deployment. In a typical deployment the default
      value of <span class="command"><strong>"any"</strong></span> is sufficient and there is no
      need to select specific methods. Changing the value of this parameter
      is the most useful in cases when an administrator wants to disable
      certain method, e.g. if the administrator trusts the network infrastructure
      more than the information provided by the clients themselves, the
      administrator may prefer information provided by the relays over that
      provided by the clients.
      </p><p>
      The configuration is controlled by the <span class="command"><strong>mac-sources</strong></span>
      parameter as follows:
        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"mac-sources": [ "method1", "method2", "method3", ... ]</code></strong>,

    "subnet6": [ ... ],

    ...
}
</pre><p>

    When not specified, a special value of "any" is used, which
    instructs the server to attempt to use all the methods in sequence and use
    value returned by the first one that succeeds. If specified, it
    has to have at least one value.</p><p>Supported methods are:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>any</strong></span> - Not an actual method, just a keyword that
        instructs Kea to try all other methods and use the first one that succeeds.
        This is the default operation if no <span class="command"><strong>mac-sources</strong></span> are defined.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>raw</strong></span> - In principle, a DHCPv6 server could use raw
        sockets to receive incoming traffic and extract MAC/hardware address
        information. This is currently not implemented for DHCPv6 and this value has
        no effect.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>duid</strong></span> - DHCPv6 uses DUID identifiers instead of
        MAC addresses. There are currently four DUID types defined, with two of them
        (DUID-LLT, which is the default one and DUID-LL) convey MAC address information.
        Although <a class="ulink" href="" target="_top">RFC 3315</a> forbids
        it, it is possible to parse those DUIDs and extract
        necessary information from them. This method is not completely reliable, as
        clients may use other DUID types, namely DUID-EN or DUID-UUID.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>ipv6-link-local</strong></span> - Another possible acquisition
        method comes from the source IPv6 address. In typical usage, clients are
        sending their packets from IPv6 link-local addresses. There is a good chance
        that those addresses are based on EUI-64, which contains MAC address. This
        method is not completely reliable, as clients may use other link-local address
        types.  In particular, privacy extensions, defined in
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4941" target="_top">RFC 4941</a>, do not use
        MAC addresses.  Also note that successful extraction requires that the
        address's u-bit must be set to 1 and its g-bit set to 0, indicating that it
        is an interface identifier as per
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2373#section-2.5.1" target="_top">
        RFC 2373, section 2.5.1</a>.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>client-link-addr-option</strong></span> - One extension defined
        to alleviate missing MAC issues is client link-layer address option, defined
        in <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6939" target="_top">RFC 6939</a>. This is
        an option that is inserted by a relay and contains information about client's
        MAC address. This method requires a relay agent that supports the option and
        is configured to insert it. This method is useless for directly connected
        clients. This parameter can also be specified as <span class="command"><strong>rfc6939</strong></span>,
        which is an alias for <span class="command"><strong>client-link-addr-option</strong></span>.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>remote-id</strong></span> -
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4649" target="_top">RFC 4649</a>
        defines a remote-id option that is inserted by a relay agent. Depending
        on the relay agent configuration, the inserted option may convey the client's
        MAC address information. This parameter can also be specified as
        <span class="command"><strong>rfc4649</strong></span>, which is an alias for <span class="command"><strong>remote-id</strong></span>.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>subscriber-id</strong></span> - Another option
        that is somewhat similar to the previous one is subscriber-id,
        defined in <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4580" target="_top">RFC
        4580</a>. It is, too, inserted by a relay agent that is
        configured to insert it. This parameter can also be specified
        as <span class="command"><strong>rfc4580</strong></span>, which is an alias for
        <span class="command"><strong>subscriber-id</strong></span>. This method is currently not
        implemented.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>docsis-cmts</strong></span> - Yet another possible source of MAC
        address information are the DOCSIS options inserted by a CMTS that acts
        as a DHCPv6 relay agent in cable networks. This method attempts to extract
        MAC address information from suboption 1026 (cm mac) of the vendor specific option
        with vendor-id=4491. This vendor option is extracted from the relay-forward message,
        not the original client's message.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>docsis-modem</strong></span> - Yet another possible source of MAC
        address information are the DOCSIS options inserted by the cable modem itself.
        This method attempts to extract MAC address information from suboption 36 (device id)
        of the vendor specific option with vendor-id=4491. This vendor option is extracted from
        the original client's message, not from any relay options.

      addresses that it is expected to hand out to the DHCPv6 clients.
      It is assumed that the server is authoritative and has complete
      jurisdiction over those addresses. However, due to various
      reasons, such as misconfiguration or a faulty client implementation
      that retains its address beyond the valid lifetime, there may be
      devices connected that use those addresses without the server's
      approval or knowledge.</p><p>Such an unwelcome event can be detected
      by legitimate clients (using Duplicate Address Detection) and
      reported to the DHCPv6 server using a DECLINE message. The server
      will do a sanity check (if the client declining an address really
      was supposed to use it), then will conduct a clean up operation
      and confirm it by sending back a REPLY message. Any DNS entries
      related to that address will be removed, the fact will be logged
      and hooks will be triggered. After that is done, the address
      will be marked as declined (which indicates that it is used by
      an unknown entity and thus not available for assignment to
      anyone) and a probation time will be set on it. Unless otherwise
      configured, the probation period lasts 24 hours. After that
      period, the server will recover the lease (i.e. put it back into
      the available state) and the address will be available for assignment
      again. It should be noted that if the underlying issue of a
      misconfigured device is not resolved, the duplicate address
      scenario will repeat. On the other hand, it provides an
      opportunity to recover from such an event automatically, without
      any sysadmin intervention.</p><p>To configure the decline probation period to a value other
      than the default, the following syntax can be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
  "Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"decline-probation-period": 3600</code></strong>,
    "subnet6": [ ... ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The parameter is expressed in seconds, so the example above will instruct
      the server to recycle declined leases after an hour.</p><p>There are several statistics and hook points associated with the
      Decline handling procedure. The lease6_decline hook is triggered after the
      incoming Decline message has been sanitized and the server is about to decline
      the lease. The declined-addresses statistic is increased after the
      hook returns (both global and subnet specific variants). (See
      <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-stats" title="8.8.Â Statistics in the DHCPv4 Server">SectionÂ 8.8, âStatistics in the DHCPv4 Serverâ</a> and <a class="xref" href="#hooks-libraries" title="ChapterÂ 14.Â Hooks Libraries">ChapterÂ 14, <i>Hooks Libraries</i></a> for more details
      on DHCPv4 statistics and Kea hook points.)</p><p>Once the probation time elapses, the declined lease is recovered
      using the standard expired lease reclamation procedure, with several
      additional steps. In particular, both declined-addresses statistics
      (global and subnet specific) are decreased. At the same time,
      reclaimed-declined-addresses statistics (again in two variants, global and
      subnet specific) are increased.</p><p>Note about statistics: The server does not decrease the
      assigned-addresses statistics when a DECLINE message is received and
      processed successfully. While technically a declined address is no longer
      assigned, the primary usage of the assigned-addresses statistic is to
      monitor pool utilization. Most people would forget to include
      declined-addresses in the calculation, and simply do
      assigned-addresses/total-addresses. This would have a bias towards
      under-representing pool utilization. As this has a potential for major
      issues, we decided not to decrease assigned addresses immediately after
      receiving Decline, but to do it later when we recover the address back to
      the available pool.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dhcp6-stats"></a>9.12.Â Statistics in the DHCPv6 Server</h2></div></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This section describes DHCPv6-specific statistics.

          Kea allows loading hook libraries that sometimes could benefit from
          additional parameters. If such a parameter is specific to the whole
          library, it is typically defined as a parameter for the hook library.
          However, sometimes there is a need to specify parameters that are
          different for each pool.
        </p><p>
          User contexts can store arbitrary data as long as it is valid JSON
          syntax and its top level element is a map (i.e. the data must be
          enclosed in curly brackets). Some hook libraries may expect specific
          formatting, though.  Please consult specific hook library
          documentation for details.
        </p><p>
          User contexts can be specified on either global scope,
          shared network, subnet, pool, client class, option data or
          definition level, and host reservation. One other useful
          usage is the ability to store comments or descriptions.
        </p><p>
          Let's consider a lightweight 4over6 deployment as an example. It is an
          IPv6 transition technology that allows mapping IPv6 prefix into full
          or parts of IPv4 addresses. In DHCP context, these are certain
          parameters that are supposed to be delivered to clients in form of
          additional options. Values of those options are correlated to
          delegated prefixes, so it is reasonable to keep those parameters
          together with the PD pool. On the other hand, lightweight 4over6 is
          not a commonly used feature, so it is not a part of the base Kea
          code. The solution to this problem is to use user context. For each PD
          pool that is expected to be used for lightweight 4over6, user context
          with extra parameters is defined. Those extra parameters will be used
          by hook library that would be loaded only when dynamic calculation of
          the lightweight 4over6 option is actually needed. An example
          configuration looks as follows:
          </p><pre class="screen">

    } ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
        </p><p>
          Kea does not interpret or use the content of the user context:
          it just stores it, making it available to the hook
          libraries. It is up to each hook library to extract the information
          and make use of it.
          The parser translates a "comment" entry into a user-context
          with the entry, this allows to attach a comment inside the
          configuration itself.

  delegate prefixes to DHCP clients. These addresses and prefixes are
  often referred to as "leases". Leases are typically assigned to clients
  for a finite amount of time, known as the "valid lifetime". DHCP clients who
  wish to continue using their assigned leases, will periodically renew them
  by sending the appropriate message to the DHCP server. The DHCP server records
  the time when these leases are renewed and calculates new expiration times
  for them.
  </p><p>If the client does not renew a lease before its valid lifetime
  elapses, the lease is considered expired. There are many situations
  when the client may cease lease renewals.  A common scenario is when
  the machine running the client shuts down for an extended period of
  time.</p><p> The process through which the DHCP server makes expired leases
  available for reassignment is referred to as "lease reclamation" and expired
  leases returned to availability through this process are referred to as
  "reclaimed".
  The DHCP server attempts to reclaim an expired lease as soon as it detects
  that it has expired. One way in which the server detects expiration occurs
  when it is trying to allocate a lease to a client and finds this
  lease already present in the database but expired.  Another way
  is by periodically querying the lease
  database for them.  Regardless of how an expired lease is detected, before
  it may assigned to a client, it must be reclaimed.
  </p><p>
  This chapter explains how to configure the server to periodically query
  for the expired leases and how to minimize the impact of the periodic lease
  reclamation process on the server's responsiveness. Finally, it explains
  "lease affinity", which provides the means to assign the same lease to a
  returning client after its lease has expired.
  </p><p>Although, all configuration examples in this section are provided
  for the DHCPv4 server, the same parameters may be used for the
  DHCPv6 server configuration.

    leases. During this process the lease entries in the database are
    modified or removed. While this is happening the server will not process incoming DHCP
    messages to avoid issues with concurrent access to database information.
    As a result, the server will be unresponsive while lease reclamation
    is performed and DHCP queries will accumulate; responses will be
    sent once the leases reclamation cycle is complete.</p><p>In deployments where response time is critical, administrators may
    wish to minimize the interruptions in service caused by lease reclamation.
    Toward this end, Kea provides configuration parameters to control: the
    frequency of lease reclamation cycles, the maximum number of leases
    processed in a single reclamation cycle, and the maximum amount of time a
    single reclamation cycle is allowed to run before being interrupted. The
    following examples demonstrate how these parameters can be used:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    ...

    "expired-leases-processing": {
        "reclaim-timer-wait-time": 5,
        "max-reclaim-leases": 0,
        "max-reclaim-time": 0,
        "flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time": 0,
    },

    ...
}
</pre><p>
    </p><p>The first parameter is expressed in seconds and specifies an
    interval between the two consecutive lease reclamation cycles. This
    is explained by the following diagram.

</p><pre class="screen">

|  c1  |            | c2 |            |c3|            | c4 |
|&lt;----&gt;|&lt;----------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;----------&gt;|&lt;&gt;|&lt;----------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|
----------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
|      |     5s     |    |     5s     |  |     5s     |    | time

</pre><p>

    </p><p>This diagram shows four lease reclamation cycles (c1 through c4) of variable duration.
    Note that the duration of the reclamation cycle depends on the number
    of expired leases detected and processed in the particular cycle. This
    duration is also usually significantly shorter than the interval between
    the cycles.
    </p><p>According to the <span class="command"><strong>reclaim-timer-wait-time</strong></span> the
    server keeps fixed intervals of five seconds between the end of one cycle
    and the start of the next cycle. This guarantees the presence of
    5s long periods during which the server remains responsive to DHCP
    queries and does not perform lease reclamation. The
    <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-leases</strong></span> and
    <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-time</strong></span> are set to 0, which sets
    no restriction on the maximum number of leases reclaimed
    in the particular cycle, or on the maximum duration of each cycle.
    </p><p>In deployments with high lease pool utilization, relatively
    short valid lifetimes, and frequently disconnecting clients which
    allow leases to expire, the number of expired leases requiring reclamation
    at any given time may rise significantly. In this case it is often
    desirable to apply restrictions on the maximum duration of a reclamation
    cycle or the maximum number of leases reclaimed in a cycle. The following
    configuration demonstrates how this can be done:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    ...

    "expired-leases-processing": {
        "reclaim-timer-wait-time": 3,
        "max-reclaim-leases": 100,
        "max-reclaim-time": 50,
        "unwarned-reclaim-cycles": 10,
    },

    ...
}

</pre><p>

    </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-leases</strong></span> parameter limits the number
    of leases reclaimed in a single cycle to 100. The
    <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-time</strong></span> limits the maximum duration of each
    cycle to 50ms. The lease reclamation cycle will be interrupted if either
    of these limitations is reached. The reclamation of all unreclaimed
    leases will be attempted in subsequent cycles.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the behavior of the system in the
    presence of many expired leases, when the limits are applied for the
    reclamation cycles.

</p><pre class="screen">

| c1 |                | c2 |                | c3 |                | c4 |
|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--------------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--------------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--------------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--
------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
|50ms|       3s       |50ms|       3s       |50ms|       3s       |50ms|  time

</pre><p>

    </p><p>The diagram demonstrates the case when each reclamation cycle would take
    more than 50ms, and thus is interrupted according to the value of the
    <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-time</strong></span>. This results in equal durations of
    all reclamation cycles over time. Note that in this example the limitation
    of maximum 100 leases is not reached. This may be the case when database
    transactions are slow or callouts in the hook libraries attached to
    the server are slow.  Regardless, the choosing values for either the
    maximum number of leases or a maximum cycle time strongly depends on the
    particular deployment, lease database backend being used, and any hooks
    libraries etc.  Administrators may need to experiment to tune the system
    to suit the dynamics of their deployment.</p><p>It is important to realize that with the use of these limits, there
    is a risk that expired leases will accumulate faster than the server can
    reclaim them.  This should not be the problem if the server is dealing
    with a temporary burst of expirations, because it should be able to
    eventually deal with them over time. However, if leases expire at a high
    rate for a longer period of time, the unreclaimed leases will pile up in
    the database. In order to notify the administrator that the current
    configuration does not satisfy the needs for reclamation of expired
    leases, the server issues a warning message in the log if it was unable
    to reclaim all leases within the last couple of reclamation cycles. The
    number of cycles after which such warning is issued is specified with the
    <span class="command"><strong>unwarned-reclaim-cycles</strong></span> configuration parameter.
    </p><p>Setting the <span class="command"><strong>reclaim-timer-wait-time</strong></span> to 0 disables
    periodic reclamation of the expired leases.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="lease-affinity"></a>10.3.Â Configuring Lease Affinity</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose that a laptop goes to a sleep mode after a period of user
    inactivity.  While the laptop is in sleep mode, its DHCP client will not
    renew leases obtained from the server and these leases will eventually
    expire.  When the laptop wakes up, it is often desirable for it to continue
    using its previous assigned IP addresses. In order to facilitate this,
    the server needs to correlate returning clients with their expired leases
    When the client returns, the server will first check for those leases and
    re-assign them if they have not been assigned to another client.  The ability
    of the server to re-assign the same lease to a returning client is
    referred to as "lease affinity".
    </p><p>When lease affinity is enabled, the server will still
    reclaim leases according to the parameters described in
    <a class="xref" href="#lease-reclaim-config" title="10.2.Â Configuring Lease Reclamation">SectionÂ 10.2, âConfiguring Lease Reclamationâ</a>, but the reclaimed leases
    will be held in the database (rather than removed) for the specified
    amount of time. When the client returns, the server will first check
    if there are any reclaimed leases associated with this client and
    re-assign them if possible. However, it is important to note that
    any reclaimed lease may be assigned to another client if that client
    specifically asks for it. Therefore, the lease affinity does not
    guarantee that the reclaimed lease will be available for the client
    who used it before; it merely increases the chances for the client to
    be assigned the same lease. If the lease pool is small (this mostly applies
    to DHCPv4 for which address space is small), there is an increased
    likelihood that the expired lease will be assigned to another client.
    </p><p>Consider the following configuration:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    ...

    "expired-leases-processing": {
        "reclaim-timer-wait-time": 3,
        "hold-reclaimed-time": 1800,
        "flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time": 5
    },

    ...
}
</pre><p>

    </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>hold-reclaim-time</strong></span> specifies how many seconds
    after an expiration a reclaimed lease should be held in the database
    for re-assignment to the same client. In the example given above,
    reclaimed leases will be held for 30 minutes (1800s) after their
    expiration. During this time, the server will likely be able to
    re-assign the same lease to the returning client, unless another client
    requests this lease and the server assigns it.</p><p>The server must periodically remove reclaimed leases for which the
    time indicated by <span class="command"><strong>hold-reclaim-time</strong></span> has elapsed. The
    <span class="command"><strong>flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time</strong></span> controls how
    often the server removes such leases. In the example provided
    above, the server will initiate removal of such leases 5 seconds after
    the previous removal attempt was completed. Setting this value to 0
    disables lease affinity, in which case leases will be removed from the
    lease database when they are reclaimed.  If lease affinity is enabled, it
    is recommended that <span class="command"><strong>hold-reclaim-time</strong></span> be set to a value significantly
    higher than the <span class="command"><strong>reclaim-timer-wait-time</strong></span>, as timely
    removal of expired-reclaimed leases is less critical while the removal
    process may impact server responsiveness.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="lease-reclamation-defaults"></a>10.4.Â Default Configuration Values for Leases Reclamation</h2></div></div></div><p>The following list presents all configuration parameters

      The DHCP-DDNS Server (kea-dhcp-ddns, known informally as D2) conducts
      the client side of the DDNS protocol (defined in  <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136" target="_top">RFC 2136</a>)
      on behalf of the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers (kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6
      respectively). The DHCP servers construct DDNS update requests, known
      as NameChangeRequests (NCRs), based upon DHCP lease change events and
      then post these to D2. D2 attempts to match each such request to the
      appropriate DNS server(s) and carry out the necessary conversation with
      those servers to update the DNS data.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp-ddns-dns-server-selection"></a>11.1.1.Â DNS Server selection</h3></div></div></div><p>
      In order to match a request to the appropriate DNS servers, D2 must have a
      catalog of servers from which to select. In fact, D2 has two such catalogs,
      one for forward DNS and one for reverse DNS; these catalogs are referred
      to as DDNS Domain Lists.  Each list consists of one or more named DDNS
      Domains. Further, each DDNS Domain has a list of one or more DNS
      servers that publish the DNS data for that domain.
      </p><p>
      When conducting forward domain matching, D2 will compare the FQDN in
      the request against the name of each forward DDNS Domain. The domain
      whose name matches the longest portion of the FQDN is considered the
      best match.  For example, if the FQDN is "myhost.sample.example.com.",
      and there are two forward domains in the catalog: "sample.example.com."
      and "example.com.", the former is regarded as the best match.  In some
      cases, it may not be possible to find a suitable match. Given the same two
      forward domains there would be no match for the FQDN, "bogus.net", so the
      request would be rejected.   Finally, if there are no forward DDNS Domains
      defined, D2 will simply disregard the forward update portion of requests.
      </p><p>
      When conducting reverse domain matching, D2 constructs a reverse
      FQDN from the lease address in the request and compare that against
      the name of each reverse DDNS Domain. Again, the domain whose name matches
      the longest portion of the FQDN is considered the best match. For instance,
      if the lease address is "172.16.1.40" and there are two reverse domains in
      the catalog: "1.16.172.in-addr.arpa." and "16.172.in-addr.arpa", the
      former is the best match.  As with forward matching, it is possible to not
      find a suitable match.  Given the same two domains, there would be no
      match for the lease address, "192.168.1.50", and the request would be
      rejected. Finally, if there are no reverse DDNS Domains defined, D2 will
      simply disregard the reverse update portion of requests.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp-ddns-conflict-resolution"></a>11.1.2.Â Conflict Resolution</h3></div></div></div><p>
        D2 implements the conflict resolution strategy prescribed by
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4703" target="_top">RFC 4703</a>.
        Conflict resolution is intended to prevent different clients from
        mapping to the same FQDN at the same time.  To make this possible, the
        RFC requires that forward DNS entries for a given FQDN must be
        accompanied by a DHCID resource record (RR).  This record contains a
        client identifier that uniquely identifies the client to whom the name
        belongs. Furthermore, any DNS updater who wishes to update or remove
        existing forward entries for an FQDN may only do so if their client
        matches that of the DHCID RR.
        </p><p>
        In other words, the DHCID RR maps an FQDN to the client to whom it
        belongs and thereafter only changes to that mapping should only be
        done by or at the behest of that client.
        </p><p>
        Currently, conflict detection is always performed.  Future releases may
        offer alternative behavior.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp-ddns-dual-stack"></a>11.1.3.Â Dual Stack Environments</h3></div></div></div><p>
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4703#section-5.2" target="_top">RFC 4703,
        sec. 5.2,</a> describes issues that may arise with dual stack
        clients. These are clients that wish to have have both IPv4 and IPv6
        mappings for the same FQDN.  In order for this work properly, such
        clients are required to embed ther IPv6 DUID within their IPv4 client
        identifier option as described in
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4361" target="_top">RFC 4703</a>.
        In this way, DNS upates for both IPv4 and IPv6 can be managed under
        the same DHCID RR. Support for this does not yet exist in Kea but is
        called for in the ticket, http://kea.isc.org/ticket/4519, which we
        hope to include in a future release.

        A DDNS protocol exchange can be conducted with or without TSIG
        (defined in <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf/org/html/rfc2845" target="_top">RFC
        2845</a>). This configuration section allows the administrator
        to define the set of TSIG keys that may be used in such
        exchanges.</p><p>To use TSIG when updating entries in a DNS Domain,
        a key must be defined in the TSIG Key List and referenced by
        name in that domain's configuration entry.  When D2 matches a
        change request to a domain, it checks whether the domain has
        a TSIG key associated with it.  If so, D2 will use that key to
        sign DNS update messages sent to and verify responses received
        from the domain's DNS server(s). For each TSIG key required by
        the DNS servers that D2 will be working with there must be a
        corresponding TSIG key in the TSIG Key list.</p><p>
        As one might gather from the name, the tsig-key section of the
        D2 configuration lists the TSIG keys.  Each entry describes a
        TSIG key used by one or more DNS servers to authenticate requests
        and sign responses.  Every entry in the list has three parameters:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

        As an example, suppose that a domain D2 will be updating is

          be that some or all of your zones are maintained by the same
          servers. You will still need one DDNS Domain per zone. Remember
          that matching a request to the appropriate server(s) is done
          by zone and a DDNS Domain only defines a single zone.
          </p><p>
          This section describes how to add Forward DDNS Domains. Repeat these

        It is permissible to add a domain without any servers. If that domain

      In certain cases it is useful to differentiate between different
      types of clients and treat them accordingly. Common reasons include:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
      The clients represent different pieces of topology, e.g. a cable
      modem is different to the clients behind that modem.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      The clients have different behavior, e.g. a smart phone behaves
      differently to a laptop.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      The clients require different values for some options, e.g. a docsis3.0
      cable modem requires different settings to docsis2.0 cable modem.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
      Conversely, different clients can be grouped into a client class to get a
      common option.
      </p><p>
      An incoming packet can be associated with a client class in
      serveral ways:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
      Implicitly, using a vendor class option or another builtin condition.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Using an expression which evaluates to true.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Using static host reservations, a shared network, a subnet, etc.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Using a hook.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
      It is envisaged that client classification will be used for
      changing the behavior of almost any part of the DHCP message
      processing. In the current release of the software however,
      there are only five mechanisms that take advantage of
      client classification: subnet selection, pool selection,
      definition of DHCPv4 private (codes 224-254) and code 43
      options, assignment of different options and, for DHCPv4 cable
      modems, the setting of specific options for use with the TFTP
      server address and the boot file field.
      </p><p>
      The process of doing classification is conducted in several steps:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
      The ALL class is associated with the incoming packet.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Vendor class options are processed.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Classes with matching expressions and not marked for later ("on
      request" or depending on the KNOWN builtin class) evaluation are
      processed in the order they are defined in the configuration:
      the boolean expression is evaluated and when it returns true
      ("match") the incoming packet is associated to the class.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      If a private or code 43 DHCPv4 option is received, decoding it
      following its client class or global (or for option 43 last
      resort) definition.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Choose a subnet, possibly based on the class information when
      some subnets are guarded. More precisely: when choosing a subnet,
      the server will iterate over all of the subnets that are
      feasible given the information found in the packet (client
      address, relay address etc). It will use the first subnet it
      finds that either doesn't have a class associated with it or
      that has a class which matches one of the packet's classes.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Host reservations are looked for. If an identifier from the incoming
      packet matches a host reservation in the subnet or shared network,
      the packet is associated with the KNOWN builtin class and all classes
      of the host reservation.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Classes with matching expressions using directly or indirectly
      the KNOWN builtin class and not marked for later ("on request")
      evaluation are processed in the order they are defined in the
      configuration: the boolean expression is evaluated and when it
      returns true ("match") the incoming packet is associated to the
      class.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      If needed, addresses and prefixes from pools are assigned,
      possibly based on the class information when some pools are
      reserved to class members.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Evaluate classes marked as "required" in the order in which they
      are listed as required: first shared network, then the subnet
      and to finally pools assigned resources belong too.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Assign options, again possibly based on the class information
      in order classes were associated with the incoming packet.
      For DHCPv4 private and code 43 options this includes class local
      option definitions.
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
      Beginning with Kea 1.4.0 release,  client classes follow the order
      in which they are specified in the configuration
      (vs. alphabetical order in previous releases). Required classes
      follow the order in which they are required.
      </p></div><p>
      When determining which options to include in the response, the
      server will examine the union of options from all of the
      assigned classes. In case when two or more classes include the
      same option, the value from the first class examined will be
      used, and classes are examined in the order they were associated
      so ALL is always the first class and matching required classes
      are last.
      </p><p>
      As an example, imagine that an incoming packet matches two
      classes.  Class "foo" defines values for an NTP server (option
      42 in DHCPv4) and an SMTP server (option 69 in DHCPv4) while
      class "bar" defines values for an NTP server and a POP3 server
      (option 70 in DHCPv4).  The server will examine the three
      options NTP, SMTP and POP3 and return any of them that the
      client requested.  As the NTP server was defined twice the

      class from which the value is obtained is unspecified.

        Care should be taken with client classification as it is easy for
        clients that do not meet class criteria to be denied any service altogether.

      Some classes are builtin so do not need to be defined. The main
      example uses Vendor Class information: The server checks whether
      an incoming DHCPv4 packet includes the vendor class identifier
      option (60) or an incoming DHCPv6 packet includes the vendor
      class option (16). If it does, the content of that option is
      prepended with "VENDOR_CLASS_" and the result is
      interpreted as a class. For example, modern cable modems will
      send this option with value "docsis3.0" and so the
      packet will belong to class "VENDOR_CLASS_docsis3.0".
      </p><p>Other examples are: the  ALL class which all incoming packets
      belong to, and the KNOWN class assigned when host reservations exist
      for the particular client. By convention, builtin classes' names
      begin with all capital letters.
      </p><p>Currently recognized builtin class names are ALL and KNOWN
      and prefixes VENDOR_CLASS_, AFTER_ and EXTERNAL_. The AFTER_ prefix
      is a provision for a not yet written hook, the EXTERNAL_ prefix
      can be freely used: builtin classes are implicitly defined so
      never raise warnings if they do not appear in the configuration.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="classification-using-expressions"></a>13.3.Â Using Expressions In Classification</h2></div></div></div><p>
      The expression portion of classification contains operators and
      values.  All values are currently strings and operators take a
      string or strings and return another string. When all the
      operations have completed the result should be a value of
      "true" or "false".  The packet belongs to
      the class (and the class name is added to the list of classes)
      if the result is "true". Expressions are written in
      standard format and can be nested.
      </p><p>
      Expressions are pre-processed during the parsing of the
      configuration file and converted to an internal
      representation. This allows certain types of errors to be caught
      and logged during parsing.  Examples of these errors include an
      incorrect number or types of arguments to an operator.  The
      evaluation code will also check for this class of error and
      generally throw an exception, though this should not occur in a
      normally functioning system.
      </p><p>
      Other issues, for example the starting position of a substring being
      outside of the substring or an option not existing in the packet, result
      in the operator returning an empty string.
      </p><p>
      Expressions are a work in progress and the supported operators and
      values are limited. The expectation is that additional operators and values
      will be added over time, however the basic mechanisms will
      remain the same.
      </p><p>
      Dependencies between classes are checked too: for instance forward
      dependencies are rejected when the configuration is parsed:
      an expression can only depend on already defined classes (including
      builtin classes) and which are evaluated in a previous or the
      same evaluation phase. This does not apply to the KNOWN class.

      Integers in an expression are converted to 32 bit unsigned integers and
      are represented as four-byte strings. For example 123 is represented as

      unsigned integers, even if the field in the packet is smaller.  In general
      it is easier to use decimal notation to represent integers, but it is also
      possible to use hex notation. When using hex notation to represent an
      integer care should be taken to make sure the value is represented as 32

        The Not, And and Or logical operators are the common operators. Not
        has the highest precedence and Or the lowest. And and Or are (left)
        associative, parentheses around a logical expression can be used
        to enforce a specific grouping, for instance in "A and (B or C)"
        (without parentheses "A and B or C" means "(A and B) or C").
      </div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp58484640"></a>13.3.2.Â Substring</h3></div></div></div>
        The substring operator "substring(value, start, length)" accepts both positive and
        negative values for the starting position and the length.  For "start", a value of
        0 is the first byte in the string while -1 is the last byte.  If the starting
        point is outside of the original string an empty string is returned.  "length"
        is the number of bytes to extract.  A negative number means to count towards
        the beginning of the string but doesn't include the byte pointed to by "start".
        The special value "all" means to return all bytes from start to the end of the
        string.  If length is longer than the remaining portion of the string then
        the entire remaining portion is returned.  Some examples may be helpful:

          <pre class="screen">
        substring('foobar', 0, 6) == 'foobar'
        substring('foobar', 3, 3) == 'bar'
        substring('foobar', 3, all) == 'bar'
        substring('foobar', 1, 4) == 'ooba'
        substring('foobar', -5, 4) == 'ooba'
        substring('foobar', -1, -3) == 'oba'
        substring('foobar', 4, -2) == 'ob'
        substring('foobar', 10, 2) == ''
          </pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp58486976"></a>13.3.3.Â Concat</h3></div></div></div>
        The concat function "concat(string1, string2)" returns the
        concatenation of its two arguments. For instance:
          <pre class="screen">
        concat('foo', 'bar') == 'foobar'
          </pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp58488448"></a>13.3.4.Â Ifelse</h3></div></div></div>
         The ifelse function "ifelse(cond, iftrue, ifelse)" returns the
         "iftrue" or "ifelse" branch value following the boolean
         condition "cond". For instance:
           <pre class="screen">
         ifelse(option[230].exists, option[230].hex, 'none')
           </pre></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
    The expression for each class is executed on each packet received.
    If the expressions are overly complex, the time taken to execute
    them may impact the performance of the server. If you need
    complex or time consuming expressions you should write a <a class="link" href="#hooks-libraries" title="ChapterÂ 14.Â Hooks Libraries">hook</a> to perform the necessary work.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="classification-configuring"></a>13.4.Â Configuring Classes</h2></div></div></div><p>
      A class contains five items: a name, a test expression, option data,
      option definition and only-if-required flag.
      The name must exist and must be unique amongst all classes. The test
      expression, option data and definition, and only-if-required flag are
      optional.
      </p><p>
      The test expression is a string containing the logical expression used to
      determine membership in the class.  The entire expression is in double
      quotes.
      </p><p>
      The option data is a list which defines any options that should be assigned
      to members of this class.
      </p><p>
      The option definition is for DHCPv4 option 43 (<a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-vendor-opts" title="8.2.11.Â DHCPv4 Vendor Specific Options">SectionÂ 8.2.11, âDHCPv4 Vendor Specific Optionsâ</a> and DHCPv4 private options
      (<a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-private-opts" title="8.2.10.Â DHCPv4 Private Options">SectionÂ 8.2.10, âDHCPv4 Private Optionsâ</a>).
      </p><p>
      Usually the test expression is evaluated before subnet selection
      but in some cases it is useful to evaluate it later when the
      subnet, shared-network or pools are known but output option
      processing not yet done. The only-if-required flag, false by default,
      allows to perform the evaluation of the test expression only
      when it was required, i.e. in a require-client-classes list of the
      selected subnet, shared-network or pool.
      </p><p>
      The require-client-classes list which is valid for shared-network,
      subnet and pool scope specifies the classes which are evaluated
      in the second pass before output option processing.
      The list is built in the reversed precedence order of option
      data, i.e. an option data in a subnet takes precedence on one
      in a shared-network but required class in a subnet is added
      after one in a shared-network.
      The mechanism is related to the only-if-required flag but it is
      not mandatory that the flag was set to true.

      In the following example the class named "Client_foo" is defined.
      It is comprised of all clients whose client ids (option 61) start with the
      string "foo". Members of this class will be given 192.0.2.1 and
      192.0.2.2 as their domain name servers.

      Currently classes can be used for two functions.  They can supply options
      to the members of the class and they can be used to choose a subnet from which an
      address will be assigned to the class member.
      </p><p>
      When supplying options, options defined as part of the class definition
      are considered "class globals".  They will override any global options that
      may be defined and in turn will be overridden by any options defined for an
      individual subnet.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp58520912"></a>13.9.Â Classes and Hooks</h2></div></div></div><p>
      You may use a hook to classify your packets. This may be useful if the
      expression would either be complex or time consuming and be easier or
      better to write as code.  Once the hook has added the proper class name
      to the packet the rest of the classification system will work as normal
      in choosing a subnet and selecting options.  For a description of
      hooks see <a class="xref" href="#hooks-libraries" title="ChapterÂ 14.Â Hooks Libraries">ChapterÂ 14, <i>Hooks Libraries</i></a>, for a description on
      configuring classes see <a class="xref" href="#classification-configuring" title="13.4.Â Configuring Classes">SectionÂ 13.4, âConfiguring Classesâ</a>

     While you are constructing your classification expressions you may
     find it useful to enable logging see <a class="xref" href="#logging" title="ChapterÂ 18.Â Logging">ChapterÂ 18, <i>Logging</i></a> for
     a more complete description of the logging facility.
     </p><p>
     To enable the debug statements in the classification system you will
     need to set the severity to "DEBUG" and the debug level to at least 55.
     The specific loggers are "kea-dhcp4.eval" and "kea-dhcp6.eval".
     </p><p>
     In order to understand the logging statements one must understand a
     bit about how expressions are evaluated, for a more complete description
     refer to the design document at <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://kea.isc.org/wiki/KeaDesigns" target="_top">http://kea.isc.org/wiki/KeaDesigns</a></code>.
     In brief there are two structures used during the evaluation of an expression:
     a list of tokens which represent the expressions and a value stack which
     represents the values being manipulated.
     </p><p>
     The list of tokens is created when the configuration file is processed with
     most expressions and values being converted to a token.  The list is organized
     in reverse Polish notation.  During execution, the list will be traversed
     in order.  As each token is executed it will be able to pop values
     from the top of the stack and eventually push its result on the top of the
     stack.  Imagine the following expression:
       </p><pre class="screen">
       "test": "substring(option[61].hex,0,3) == 'foo'",
       </pre><p>
     This will result in the following tokens:
       </p><pre class="screen">
       option, number (0), number (3), substring, text ('foo'), equals
       </pre><p>
     In this example the first three tokens will simply push values onto the
     stack.  The substring token will then remove those three values and
     compute a result that it places on the stack.  The text option also
     places a value on the stack and finally the equals token removes the
     two tokens on the stack and places its result on the stack.
     </p><p>
     When debug logging is enabled, each time a token is evaluated it will
     emit a log message indicating the values of any objects that were popped
     off of the value stack and any objects that were pushed onto the value
     stack.
     </p><p>
     The values will be displayed as either text if the command is known
     to use text values or hexadecimal if the command either uses binary values or
     can manipulate either text or binary values.  For expressions that
     pop multiple values off the stack, the values will be displayed in
     the order they were popped.  For most expressions this won't matter
     but for the concat expression the values are displayed in reverse
     order from how they are written in the expression.
     </p><p>
     Let us assume that the following test has been entered into the configuration.
     This example skips most of the configuration to concentrate on the test.
       </p><pre class="screen">
       "test": "substring(option[61].hex,0,3) == 'foo'",
       </pre><p>
     The logging might then resemble this:
       </p><pre class="screen">
       2016-05-19 13:35:04.163 DEBUG [kea.eval/44478] EVAL_DEBUG_OPTION Pushing option 61 with value 0x666F6F626172

     The debug logging may be quite verbose if you have a number of expressions
     to evaluate.  It is intended as an aid in helping you create and debug
     your expressions.  You should plan to disable debug logging when you have your
     expressions working correctly.  You also may wish to include only one set of
     expressions at a time in the configuration file while debugging them in order
     to limit the log statements.  For example when adding a new set of expressions
     you might find it more convenient to create a configuration file that only
     includes the new expressions until you have them working correctly and then
     add the new set to the main configuration file.

      Although Kea offers a lot of flexibility, there may be cases where
      its behavior needs customization.  To accommodate this possibility,
      Kea includes the idea of "Hooks".  This feature lets Kea load one
      or more dynamically-linked libraries (known as "hooks libraries")
      and, at various points in its processing ("hook points"), call
      functions in them.  Those functions perform whatever custom
      processing is required.
      </p><p>
        The hooks concept also allows keeping the core Kea code reasonably small
        by moving features that some, but not all users find useful to external
        libraries. People who don't need specific functionality simply don't
        load the libraries.
      </p><p>
      Hooks libraries are attached to individual Kea processes, not to
      Kea as a whole.  This means (for example) that it is possible
      to associate one set of libraries with the DHCP4 server and a
      different set to the DHCP6 server.
      </p><p>
      Another point to note is that it is possible for a process to
      load multiple libraries.  When processing reaches a hook point,
      Kea calls the hooks library functions attached to it.  If multiple
      libraries have attached a function to a given hook point, Kea calls
      all of them, in the order in which the libraries are specified in
      the configuration file. The order may be important: consult the
      documentation of the libraries to see if this is the case.
      </p><p>
      The next section describes how to configure hooks libraries. If you
      are interested in writing your own hooks library, information can be
      found in the <a class="ulink" href="https://jenkins.isc.org/job/Kea_doc/doxygen" target="_top">Kea
      Developer's Guide</a>.
      </p><p>
        Note that some libraries are available under different licenses.
      </p><p>
        Note that some libraries may require additional dependencies and/or
        compilation switches to be enabled, e.g. Radius library introduced in
        Kea 1.4 requires FreeRadius-client library to be present. If
        --with-free-radius option is not specified, the Radius library will not
        be built.

Kea 1.3.0 and
        earlier needed special switches passed to configure script to detect the
        hook libraries. Please see this KB article: <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01587" target="_top">https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01587</a></code>
        .</p></div><p>Some hook packages are included in the base Kea sources. There is no
      need to do anything special to compile or install them, they are covered
      by the usual building and installation procedure. ISC also provides several
      additional hooks in form of various packages. All of those packages follow
      the same installation procedure that is similar to base Kea, but has
      several additional steps. For your convenience, the whole procedure is
      described here. Please refer to <a class="xref" href="#installation" title="ChapterÂ 3.Â Installation">ChapterÂ 3, <i>Installation</i></a> for general
      overview.</p><p>
        1. Download the package. You will receive detailed instructions how to
        get it separately. This will be a file with a name similar to
        kea-premium-1.4.0.tar.gz. Your name may differ depending on which
        package you got.
      </p><p>
        2. If you have the sources for the corresponding version of the
        open-source Kea package still on your system (from when you installed
        Kea), skip this step.  Otherwise extract the Kea source from the
        original tarball you downloaded.  For example, if you downloaded Kea
        1.4.0., you should have a tarball called kea-1.4.0.tar.gz on your
        system. Unpack this tarball:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ <strong class="userinput"><code>tar zxvf kea-1.4.0.tar.gz</code></strong>
</pre><p>

        This will unpack the tarball into the kea-1.4.0 subdirectory of your
        current working directory.
      </p><p>
        3. Unpack the Kea premium tarball into the directory into which Kea was
        unpacked. For example, assuming that you followed step 2 and that Kea
        1.4.0 has been unpacked into a kea-1.4.0 subdirectory and that the Kea
        premium tarball is in your current directory, the following steps will
        unpack the premium tarball into the correct location:
</p><pre class="screen">
  $ <strong class="userinput"><code>cd kea-1.4.0</code></strong>
  $ <strong class="userinput"><code>tar xvf ../kea-premium-1.4.0.tar.gz</code></strong>
</pre><p>
        Note that unpacking the Kea premium package will put the files into a
        directory named premium. Regardless of the name of your package, the
        directory will always be called premium, just its content may vary.
      </p><p>
        4. Run autoreconf tools. This step is necessary to update Kea's build
        script to include additional directory. If this tool is not already
        available on your system, you need to install automake and autoconf
        tools. To generate configure script, please use:
</p><pre class="screen">
  $ <strong class="userinput"><code>autoreconf -i</code></strong>
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        5. Rerun configure, using the same configure options as you used when
        originally building Kea. You can check if configure has detected the
        premium package by inspecting the summary printed when it exits.  The
        first section of the output should look something like:
</p><pre class="screen">
Package:
  Name:            kea
  Version:         1.4.0
  Extended version:1.4.0 (tarball)
  OS Family:       Linux
  Using GNU sed:   yes
  Premium package: yes
  Included Hooks:  forensic_log flex_id host_cmds
</pre><p>

The last line indicates which specific hooks were detected. Note that some
hooks may require its own dedicated switches, e.g. radius hook requires
extra switches for FreeRADIUS. Please consult later sections of this
chapter for details.
      </p><p>
        6. Rebuild Kea
</p><pre class="screen">
  $ <strong class="userinput"><code>make</code></strong>
</pre><p>
If your machine has multiple CPU cores, interesting option to consider here
is -j X, where X is the number of available cores.
      </p><p>
        7. Install Kea sources together with hooks:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ <strong class="userinput"><code>sudo make install</code></strong>
</pre><p>
      Note that as part of the installation procedure, the install script will
      eventually venture into premium/ directory and will install additional
      hook libraries and associated files.
      </p><p>
      The installation location of the hooks libraries depends whether you
      specified --prefix parameter to the configure script. If you did not,
      the default location will be /usr/local/lib/hooks. You can verify the
      libraries are installed properly with this command:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ <strong class="userinput"><code>ls -l /usr/local/lib/hooks/*.so</code></strong>
/usr/local/lib/hooks/libdhcp_flex_id.so
/usr/local/lib/hooks/libdhcp_host_cmds.so
/usr/local/lib/hooks/libdhcp_lease_cmds.so
/usr/local/lib/hooks/libdhcp_legal_log.so
/usr/local/lib/hooks/libdhcp_subnet_cmds.so
</pre><p>
      The exact list you see will depend on the packages you have.
      If you specified directory via --prefix, the hooks libraries
      will be located in {prefix directory}/lib/hooks.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp58545328"></a>14.3.Â Configuring Hooks Libraries</h2></div></div></div><p>
      The hooks libraries for a given process are configured using the
      <span class="command"><strong>hooks-libraries</strong></span> keyword in the
      configuration for that process. (Note that
      the word "hooks" is plural).  The value of the keyword
      is an array of map structures, each structure corresponding to a hooks
      library.  For example, to set up two hooks libraries for the DHCPv4
      server, the configuration would be:
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>"Dhcp4": {
    :
    "hooks-libraries": [
        {
            "library": "/opt/charging.so"
        },
        {
            "library": "/opt/local/notification.so",
            "parameters": {
                "mail": "spam@example.com",
                "floor": 13,
                "debug": false,
                "users": [ "alice", "bob", "charlie" ],
                "languages": {
                    "french": "bonjour",
                    "klingon": "yl'el"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
    :
}</code></strong>

      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        This is a change to the syntax used in Kea 0.9.2 and earlier, where
        hooks-libraries was a list of strings, each string being the name of
        a library.  The change was made in Kea 1.0 to facilitate the
        specification of library-specific parameters, a capability
        available in Kea 1.1.0 onwards. Libraries should allow a parameter
        entry where to put comments as it is done for many configuration
        scopes with comment and user context.
      </p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
          The library reloading behavior has changed in Kea 1.1. Libraries are
          reloaded, even if their list hasn't changed. Kea does that, because
          the parameters specified for the library (or the files those
          parameters point to) may have changed.
          </p></div><p>
        Libraries may have additional parameters. Those are not mandatory in the
        sense that there may be libraries that don't require them. However, for
        specific library there is often specific requirement for specify certain
        set of parameters. Please consult the documentation for your library
        for details. In the example above, the first library has no parameters.
        The second library has five parameters, specifying mail (string
        parameter), floor (integer parameter), debug (boolean parameter) and
        even lists (list of strings) and maps (containing strings). Nested
        parameters could be used if the library supports it. This topic is
        explained in detail in the Hooks Developer's Guide in the "Configuring
        Hooks Libraries" section.

          </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
          There is one case where this is not true: if Kea
          is running with a configuration that contains a
          <span class="command"><strong>hooks-libraries</strong></span> item, and that item is
          removed and the configuration reloaded, the removal will be
          ignored and the libraries remain loaded.  As a workaround,
          instead of removing the <span class="command"><strong>hooks-libraries</strong></span>

          </p></div></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
      At the present time, only the kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 processes support
      hooks libraries.

      As described above, the hooks functionality provides a way to customize
      a Kea server without modifying the core code.  ISC has chosen to take
      advantage of this feature to provide functions that may only be useful
      to a subset of Kea users.  To this end ISC has created some hooks
      libraries; these discussed in the following sections.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
      Some of these libraries will be available with the base code while others
      will be shared with organizations supporting development of Kea
      , possibly as a 'benefit' or 'thank you' for helping to sustain
      the larger Kea project. If you would like to get access to those
      libraries, please consider taking out a support contract: this includes
      professional support, advance security notifications, input into our
      roadmap planning, and many other benefits, while helping
      making Kea sustainable in the long term.
      </p></div><p>Currently the following libraries are available or planned from ISC:

        </p><div class="table"><a name="hook-libs"></a><p class="title"><b>TableÂ 14.1.Â List of available hooks libraries</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="List of available hooks libraries" border="1"><colgroup><col class="name"><col class="avail"><col class="description"></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Availability</th><th>Since</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>user_chk</td><td>Kea sources</td><td>Kea 0.8</td><td>Reads known users list from a file. Unknown users
              will be assigned a
              lease from the last subnet defined in the configuration file,
              e.g. to redirect them a captive portal. This demonstrates how an
              external source of information can be used to influence the Kea
              allocation engine. This hook is part of the Kea source code and is
              available in the src/hooks/dhcp/user_chk directory.</td></tr><tr><td>Forensic Logging</td><td>Support customers</td><td>Kea 1.1.0</td><td>This library provides hooks that record a detailed log of
              lease assignments and renewals into a set of log files. In many
              legal jurisdictions companies, especially ISPs, must record
              information about the addresses they have leased to DHCP
              clients. This library is designed to help with that
              requirement. If the information that it records is sufficient it
              may be used directly. If your jurisdiction requires that you save
              a different set of information, you may use it as a template or
              example and create your own custom logging hooks.</td></tr><tr><td>Flexible Identifier</td><td>Support customers</td><td>Kea 1.2.0</td><td>Kea software provides a way to handle host reservations
              that include addresses, prefixes, options, client classes and
              other features. The reservation can be based on hardware address,
              DUID, circuit-id or client-id in DHCPv4 and using hardware address
              or DUID in DHCPv6. However, there are sometimes scenarios where the
              reservation is more complex, e.g. uses other options that
              mentioned above, uses part of specific options or perhaps even a
              combination of several options and fields to uniquely identify a
              client. Those scenarios are addressed by the Flexible Identifiers
              hook application. It allows defining an expression, similar to
              the one used in client classification,
              e.g. substring(relay6[0].option[37],0,6). Each incoming packet is
              evaluated against that expression and its value is then searched
              in the reservations database.
              </td></tr><tr><td>Host Commands</td><td>Support customers</td><td>Kea 1.2.0</td><td>Kea provides a way to store host reservations in a
              database. In many larger deployments it is useful to be able to
              manage that information while the server is running. This library
              provides management commands for adding, querying and deleting
              host reservations in a safe way without restarting the server.
              In particular, it validates the parameters, so an attempt to
              insert incorrect data, e.g. add a host with conflicting identifier
              in the same subnet will be rejected. Those commands are
              exposed via command channel (JSON over unix sockets) and Control
              Agent (JSON over RESTful interface). Additional commands and
              capabilities related to host reservations will be added in the
              future.</td></tr><tr><td>Subnet Commands</td><td>Support customers</td><td>Kea 1.3.0</td><td>In deployments in which subnet configuration needs to
              be frequently updated, it is a hard requirement that such updates be
              performed without the need for a full DHCP server reconfiguration
              or restart. This hooks library allows for incremental changes
              to the subnet configuration such as: adding a subnet, removing
              a subnet. It also allows for listing all available subnets and
              fetching detailed information about a selected subnet. The
              commands exposed by this library do not affect other subnets
              or configuration parameters currently used by the server.
              </td></tr><tr><td>Lease Commands</td><td>Kea sources</td><td>Kea 1.3.0</td><td>The lease commands hook library offers a number of new
              commands used to manage leases. Kea provides a way to store lease
              information in various backends: memfile, MySQL, PostgreSQL and
              Cassandra. This library provides a unified interface that can
              manipulate leases in an unified, safe way. In particular, it
              allows: manipulate leases in memfile while Kea is running, sanity
              check changes, check lease existence and remove all leases
              belonging to specific subnet. It can also catch more obscure
              errors, like adding a lease with subnet-id that does not exist in
              the configuration or configuring a lease to use an address that is
              outside of the subnet to which it is supposed to belong.
              </td></tr><tr><td>High Availability</td><td>Support customers</td><td>Kea 1.4.0</td><td>Minimizing a risk of DHCP service unavailability is
              achieved by setting up a pair of the DHCP servers in a network.
              Two modes of operation are supported. The first one is called load
              balancing and is sometimes referred to as active-active. Each
              server can handle selected group of clients in this network or all
              clients, if it detects that its partner has became unavailable.
              It is also possible
              to designate one server to serve all DHCP clients, and leave
              another server as "standby". This mode is called hot standby and
              is sometimes referenced to as active-passive. This server will
              activate its DHCP function when it detects that its partner is not
              available.  Such cooperation between the DHCP servers requires
              that these servers constantly communicate with each other to send
              updates about allocated leases and to periodically test whether
              their partners are still operational. The hook library also
              provides an ability to send lease updates to external backup
              server, making it much easier to have a replacement that is almost
              up to date. The "libdhcp_ha" library provides such functionality
              for Kea DHCP servers.
              </td></tr><tr><td>Radius</td><td>Support customers</td><td>Kea 1.4.0</td><td>The RADIUS Hook library allows Kea to interact with the
              RADIUS servers using access and accounting mechanisms. The access
              mechanism may be used for access control, assigning specific IPv4
              or IPv6 addresses reserved by RADIUS, dynamically assigning
              addresses from designated pools chosen by RADIUS or rejecting
              the client's messages altogether. The accounting mechanism allows
              RADIUS server to keep track of device activity over time.
              </td></tr><tr><td>Host Cache</td><td>Support customers</td><td>Kea 1.4.0</td><td>Some of the database backends, such as RADIUS, are
              considered slow and may take a long time to respond. Since Kea in
              general is synchronous, the backend performance directly affects
              the DHCP performance. To minimize the impact and improve
              performance, the Host Cache library provides a way to cache
              responses from other hosts. This includes negative caching,
              i.e. the ability to remember that there is no client information
              in the database.
              </td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p><br class="table-break">

      </p><p>
        ISC hopes to see more hooks libraries become available as time
        progresses, both developed internally and externally. Since
        this list may evolve dynamically, we decided to keep it on a
        wiki page, available at this link: <a class="ulink" href="http://kea.isc.org/wiki/Hooks" target="_top">http://kea.isc.org/wiki/Hooks</a>.
        If you are a developer or are aware of any hooks libraries not
        listed there, please send a note to the kea-users or kea-dev
        mailing lists and someone will update it.
      </p><p>
        The libraries developed by ISC are described in detail in the following sections.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp58614576"></a>14.4.1.Â user_chk: Checking User Access</h3></div></div></div><p>
          The user_chk library is the first hooks library published by ISC. It
          attempts to serve several purposes:

          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>To assign "new" or "unregistered" users to a
              restricted subnet, while "known" or "registered" users are assigned
              to unrestricted subnets.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>To allow DHCP response options or vendor option
              values to be customized based upon user identity. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>To provide a real time record of the user registration
              activity which can be sampled by an external consumer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> To serve as a demonstration of various capabilities
              possible using the hooks interface.</p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>
          Once loaded, the library allows segregating incoming requests into
          known and unknown clients. For known clients, the packets are
          processed mostly as usual, except it is possible to override certain
          options being sent. That can be done on a per host basis. Clients
          that are not on the known hosts list will be treated as unknown and
          will be assigned to the last subnet defined in the configuration file.
        </p><p>
          As an example of use, this behavior may be used to put unknown users into a
          separate subnet that leads to a walled garden, where they can only
          access a registration portal. Once they fill in necessary data, their
          details are added to the known clients file and they get a proper
          address after their device is restarted.
        </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This library was developed several years before the host
        reservation mechanism has become available. Currently host reservation is
        much more
        powerful and flexible, but nevertheless the user_chk capability to consult
        and external source of information about clients and alter Kea's
        behavior is useful and remains of educational value.
        </p></div><p>
          The library reads the /tmp/user_chk_registry.txt file while being
          loaded and each time an incoming packet is processed. The file is expected
          to have each line contain a self-contained JSON snippet which must
          have the following two entries:

          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span>, whose value

        This section describes the forensic log hooks library. This library
        provides hooks that record a detailed log of lease assignments
        and renewals into a set of log files.  Currently this library
        is only available to ISC customers with a support contract.
        </p><p>
        In many legal jurisdictions companies, especially ISPs, must record
        information about the addresses they have leased to DHCP clients.
        This library is designed to help with that requirement.  If the
        information that it records is sufficient it may be used directly.
        If your jurisdiction requires that you save a different set of
        information you may use it as a template or example and create your
        own custom logging hooks.
        </p><p>
        This logging is done as a set of hooks to allow it to be customized
        to any particular need.  Modifying a hooks library is easier and
        safer than updating the core code.  In addition by using the hooks
        features those users who don't need to log this information can
        leave it out and avoid any performance penalties.

          The "path" and "base-name" are supplied in the

          To use this functionality the hook library must be included in the
          configuration of the desired DHCP server modules. The legal_log
          library is installed alongside the Kea libraries in
          <code class="filename">[kea-install-dir]/lib</code> where
          <code class="filename">kea-install-dir</code> is determined by the
          "--prefix" option of the configure script.  It defaults to
          <code class="filename">/usr/local</code>.  Assuming the
          default value then, configuring kea-dhcp4 to load the legal_log
          library could be done with the following Kea4 configuration:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { <strong class="userinput"><code>
    "hooks-libraries": [

                "path": "/var/kea/var",
                "base-name": "kea-forensic4"
            }
        },
        ...
    ] </code></strong>
}
</pre><p>
          </p><p>
          To configure it for kea-dhcp6, the commands are simply as shown below:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { <strong class="userinput"><code>
    "hooks-libraries": [
        {
            "library": "/usr/local/lib/libdhcp_legal_log.so",

            }
        },
        ...
    ] </code></strong>
}
</pre><p>
          </p><p>
          Two Hook Library parameters are supported:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            path - the directory in which the forensic file(s) will be written.  The
            default value is
            <code class="filename">[prefix]/kea/var</code>.  The directory must exist.
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            base-name - an arbitrary value which is used in conjunction with
            the current system date to form the current forensic file name.  It defaults
            to <code class="filename">kea-legal</code>.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>
          </p><p>
            If it is desired to restrict forensic logging to certain subnets, the
            "legal-logging" boolean parameter can be specified within a user context of
            these subnets. For example:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcpv4" {
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",

                     "pool": "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200"
                }
            ],
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"user-context": {
                "legal-logging": false
            }</code></strong>
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
              disables legal logging for the subnet "192.0.2.0/24". If this parameter
              is not specified, it defaults to 'true', which enables legal logging for
              the subnet.
          </p><p>
            The following example demonstrates how to selectively disable legal logging
            for an IPv6 subnet.

          This section describes a hook application dedicated to generate
          flexible identifiers for host reservation. Kea software provides a way
          to handle host reservations that include addresses, prefixes, options,
          client classes and other features. The reservation can be based on
          hardware address, DUID, circuit-id or client-id in DHCPv4 and using
          hardware address or DUID in DHCPv6. However, there are sometimes
          scenarios where the reservation is more complex, e.g. uses other
          options that mentioned above, uses part of specific options or perhaps
          even a combination of several options and fields to uniquely identify
          a client. Those scenarios are addressed by the Flexible Identifiers
        hook application.</p><p>Currently this library is only available to ISC customers with a
        support contract.</p><p>The library allows for defining an expression, using notation
        initially used for client classification only. See <a class="xref" href="#classification-using-expressions" title="13.3.Â Using Expressions In Classification">SectionÂ 13.3, âUsing Expressions In Classificationâ</a> for detailed description
        of the syntax available. One notable difference is that for client
        classification the expression currently has to evaluate to either true
        or false, while the flexible identifier expression is expected to
        evaluate to a string that will be used as identifier. It is a valid case
        for the expression to evaluate to empty string (e.g. in cases where a
        client does not sent specific options). This expression is then
        evaluated for each incoming packet. This evaluation generates an
        identifier that is used to identify the client. In particular, there may
        be host reservations that are tied to specific values of the flexible
        identifier.</p><p>
          The library can be loaded in similar way as other hook libraries. It
          takes a mandatory parameter identifier-expression and optional
          boolean parameter replace-client-id:

        </p><p>
          The flexible identifier library supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.
        </p><p>
          EXAMPLE: Let's consider a case of an IPv6 network that has an
          independent interface for each of the connected customers. Customers
          are able to plug in whatever device they want, so any type of
          identifier (e.g. a client-id) is unreliable. Therefore the operator
          may decide to use an option inserted by a relay agent to differentiate
          between clients. In this particular deployment, the operator verified
          that the interface-id is unique for each customer facing
          interface. Therefore it is suitable for usage as reservation. However,
          only the first 6 bytes of the interface-id are interesting, because
          remaining bytes are either randomly changed or not unique between
          devices. Therefore the customer decided to use first 6 bytes of the
          interface-id option inserted by the relay agent. After adding "flex-id"
          host-reservation-identifiers goal can be achieved by using the
          following configuration:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "subnet6": [{ ..., // subnet definition starts here
    "reservations": [
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"flex-id": "'port1234'"</code></strong>, // value of the first 8 bytes of the interface-id
        "ip-addresses": [ "2001:db8::1" ]
    ],
    }], // end of subnet definitions
    "host-reservation-identifiers": ["duid", "flex-id"], // add "flex-id" to reservation identifiers
    "hooks-libraries": [
        {
            "library": "/path/libdhcp_flex_id.so",
            "parameters": {
                "identifier-expression": "<strong class="userinput"><code>substring(relay6[0].option[18].hex,0,8)</code></strong>"
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
</pre><p>
        </p><p>
          NOTE: Care should be taken when adjusting the expression. If the
          expression changes, then all the flex-id values may change, possibly
          rendering all reservations based on flex-id unusable until they're
          manually updated. Therefore it is strongly recommended to start with
          the expression and a handful reservations, adjust the expression as
          needed and only after it was confirmed the expression does exactly
          what is expected out of it go forward with host reservations on any
          broader scale.
        </p><p>
          flex-id values in host reservations can be specified in two
          ways. First, they can be expressed as hex string, e.g. bar string
          can be represented as 626174. Alternatively, it can be expressed
          as quoted value (using double and single quotes), e.g. "'bar'".
          The former is more convenient for printable characters, while hex
          string values are more convenient for non-printable characters.
        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "subnet6": [{ ..., // subnet definition starts here
    "reservations": [
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"flex-id": "01:02:03:04:05:06"</code></strong>, // value of the first 8 bytes of the interface-id
        "ip-addresses": [ "2001:db8::1" ]
    ],
    }], // end of subnet definitions
    "host-reservation-identifiers": ["duid", "flex-id"], // add "flex-id" to reservation identifiers
    "hooks-libraries": [
        {
            "library": "/path/libdhcp_flex_id.so",
            "parameters": {
                "identifier-expression": "<strong class="userinput"><code>vendor[4491].option[1026].hex</code></strong>"
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
</pre><p>
          When "replace-client-id" is set to false (which is the default setting),
          the flex-id hook library uses evaluated flexible identifier solely for
          identifying host reservations, i.e. searching for reservations within a
          database. This is a functional equivalent of other identifiers,
          similar to hardware address or circuit-id. However,
          this mode of operation has an implication that if a client device is
          replaced, it may cause a conflict between an existing lease (allocated
          for old device) and the new lease being allocated for the new device. The
          conflict arises because the same flexible identifier is computed for the
          replaced device and the server will try to allocate the same lease. The
          mismatch between client identifiers sent by new device and old device causes
          the server to refuse this new allocation until the old lease expires.
          A manifestation of this problem is dependant on specific expression
          used as flexible identifier and is likely to appear if you only use options
          and other parameters that are identifying where the device is
          connected (e.g. circuit-id), rather than the device identification
          itself (e.g. MAC address).
        </p><p>
          The flex-id library offers a way to overcome the problem with lease conflicts
          by dynamically replacing client identifier (or DUID in DHCPv6 case) with a
          value derived from flexible identifier. The server processes the client's
          query as if flexible identifier was sent in the client identifier (or DUID)
          option. This guarantees that returning client (for which the same flexible
          identifier is evaluated) will be assigned the same lease despite the client
          identifier and/or MAC address change.
        </p><p>
          The following is a stub configuration that enables this behavior:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { <strong class="userinput"><code>
    "hooks-libraries": [
        {
            "library": "/path/libdhcp_flex_id.so",
            "parameters": {
                "identifier-expression": "<strong class="userinput"><code>expression</code></strong>",
                "replace-client-id": "<strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>"
            }
        },
        ...
    ] </code></strong>
}
</pre><p>
        </p><p>
          In the DHCPv4 case, the value derived from the flexible identifier is formed
          by prepending 1 byte with a value of zero to flexible identifier. In the IPv6
          case, it is formed by prepanding two zero bytes before the flexible identifier.
        </p><p>
          Note that for this mechanism to take effect, the DHCPv4 server must be configured
          to respect the client identifier option value during lease allocation, i.e.
          "match-client-id" must be set to true. See
          <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-match-client-id" title="8.2.19.Â Using Client Identifier and Hardware Address">SectionÂ 8.2.19, âUsing Client Identifier and Hardware Addressâ</a> for details. No additional settings
          are required for DHCPv6.
        </p><p>
          If "replace-client-id" option is set to true, the value of "echo-client-id"
          parameter (that governs whether to send back a client-id option or
          not) is ignored.
        </p><p>
          The <a class="xref" href="#lease-cmds" title="14.4.5.Â lease_cmds: Lease Commands">SectionÂ 14.4.5, âlease_cmds: Lease Commandsâ</a> section describes commands used to retrieve,
          update and delete leases using various identifiers, e.g. "hw-address",
          "client-id". The lease_cmds library doesn't natively support querying for
          leases by flexible identifier. However, when "replace-client-id" is set to
          true, it makes it possible to query for leases using a value derived from
          the flexible identifier. In the DHCPv4 case, the query will look similar to this:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "command": "lease4-get",
    "arguments": {
        "identifier-type": "client-id",
        "identifier": "00:<strong class="userinput"><code>54:64:45:66</code></strong>",
        "subnet-id": 44
    }
}
</pre><p>

            where hexadecimal value of "54:64:45:66" is a flexible identifier computed
            for the client.
        </p><p>
          In the DHCPv6 case, the corresponding query will look similar to this:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "command": "lease6-get",
    "arguments": {
        "identifier-type": "duid",
        "identifier": "00:00:<strong class="userinput"><code>54:64:45:66</code></strong>",
        "subnet-id": 10
    }
}</pre><p>

          This section describes a hook application that offers a number of new
          commands used to query and manipulate host reservations. Kea provides
          a way to store host reservations in a database. In many larger
          deployments it is useful to be able to manage that information while
          the server is running. This library provides management commands for
          adding, querying and deleting host reservations in a safe way without
          restarting the server.  In particular, it validates the parameters, so
          an attempt to insert incorrect data e.g. add a host with conflicting
          identifier in the same subnet will be rejected. Those commands are
          exposed via command channel (JSON over unix sockets) and Control Agent
          (JSON over RESTful interface). Additional commands and capabilities
          related to host reservations will be added in the future.
        </p><p>Currently this library is only available to ISC customers with a
        support contract.</p><p>
          Currently three commands are supported: reservation-add (which adds
          new host reservation), reservation-get (which returns existing
          reservation if specified criteria are matched) and reservation-del
          (which attempts to delete a reservation matching specified
          criteria). To use commands that change the reservation information
          (currently these are reservation-add and reservation-del, but this
          rule applies to other commands that may be implemented in the future),
          hosts database must be specified (see hosts-databases description in
          <a class="xref" href="#hosts-databases-configuration4" title="8.2.3.1.Â DHCPv4 Hosts Database Configuration">SectionÂ 8.2.3.1, âDHCPv4 Hosts Database Configurationâ</a> and <a class="xref" href="#hosts-databases-configuration6" title="9.2.3.1.Â DHCPv6 Hosts Database Configuration">SectionÂ 9.2.3.1, âDHCPv6 Hosts Database Configurationâ</a>) and it must not operate in
          read-only mode. If the hosts-databases are not specified or are running
          in read-only mode, the host_cmds library will load, but any attempts
          to use reservation-add or reservation-del will fail.
        </p><p>
          Additional host reservation commands are planned in the future. For
          a description of envisaged commands, see
<a class="ulink" href="http://kea.isc.org/wiki/ControlAPIRequirements" target="_top">Control API
Requirements </a> document.</p><p>
          All commands are using JSON syntax. They can be issued either using
          control channel (see <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel" title="ChapterÂ 16.Â Management API">ChapterÂ 16, <i>Management API</i></a>) or via Control
          Agent (see <a class="xref" href="#kea-ctrl-agent" title="ChapterÂ 7.Â Kea Control Agent">ChapterÂ 7, <i>Kea Control Agent</i></a>).
        </p><p>
          The library can be loaded in similar way as other hook libraries. It
          does not take any parameters. It supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
          servers.

          identifier-type, identifier). The first type of query is used when the
          address (either IPv4 or IPv6) is known, but the details of the
          reservation aren't. One common use case of this type of query is to
          find out whether a given address is reserved or not. The second query
          uses identifiers. For maximum flexibility, Kea stores the host
          identifying information as a pair of values: type and the actual
          identifier. Currently supported identifiers are "hw-address", "duid",
          "circuit-id", "client-id" and "flex-id", but additional types may be
          added in the future. If any new identifier types are defined in the
          future, reservation-get command will support them
          automatically.</p><p>
            An example command for getting a host reservation by (subnet-id,

          of host parameters will be returned. An example of a query that
          did not find the host looks as follows:

          This section describes the hook library that offers a number of new
          commands used to manage leases. Kea provides a way to store lease
          information in several backends (memfile, MySQL, PostgreSQL and
          Cassandra). This library provides a unified interface that can
          manipulate leases in an unified, safe way. In particular, it allows
          things previously impossible: manipulate leases in memfile while Kea
          is running, sanity check changes, check lease existence and remove all
          leases belonging to specific subnet. It can also catch more obscure
          errors, like adding a lease with subnet-id that does not exist in the
          configuration or configuring a lease to use an address that is outside
          of the subnet to which it is supposed to belong.
        </p><p>There are many use cases when an administrative command may be
        useful: during migration between servers (possibly even between
        different vendors), when a certain network is being retired, when a
        device has been disconnected and the sysadmin knows for sure that it
        will not be coming back. The "get" queries may be useful for automating
        certain management and monitoring tasks. They can also act as
        preparatory steps for lease updates and removals.</p><p>
          This library provides the following commands:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>lease4-add</strong></span> - adds new IPv4 lease;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>lease6-add</strong></span> - adds new IPv6 lease;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>lease4-get</strong></span> - checks if an IPv4 lease with

        </p><p>Lease commands library is part of the open source code and is
        available to every Kea user.</p><p>
          All commands are using JSON syntax. They can be issued either using
          control channel (see <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel" title="ChapterÂ 16.Â Management API">ChapterÂ 16, <i>Management API</i></a>) or via Control
          Agent (see <a class="xref" href="#kea-ctrl-agent" title="ChapterÂ 7.Â Kea Control Agent">ChapterÂ 7, <i>Kea Control Agent</i></a>).
        </p><p>
          The library can be loaded in the same way as other hook libraries. It
          does not take any parameters. It supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
          servers.

          <span class="command"><strong>lease4-add</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>lease6-add</strong></span>
          commands allow for the creation of a new lease. Typically Kea creates a lease
          on its own, when it first sees a new device. However, sometimes it may
          be convenient to create the lease administratively. The
          <span class="command"><strong>lease4-add</strong></span> command requires at least three
          parameters: an IPv4 address, a subnet-id and an identifier: hardware
          (MAC) address. The simplest successful call might look as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "command": "lease4-add",
    "arguments": {
        "subnet-id": 44,
        "ip-address": "192.0.2.202",
        "hw-address": "1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f"
    }
}
</pre><p>
        </p><p><span class="command"><strong>lease6-add</strong></span> command requires four
        parameters: an IPv6 address, a subnet-id, and IAID value
        (identity association identifier, a value sent by clients) and
        a DUID:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "command": "lease6-add",
    "arguments": {
        "subnet-id": 66,
        "ip-address": "2001:db8::3",
        "duid": "1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f:20:21:22:23:24",
        "iaid": 1234
    }
}</pre><p>

<span class="command"><strong>lease6-add</strong></span> can be also used to add leases for IPv6
prefixes. In this case there are two parameters that must be
specified: type (set to value of "IA_PD") and a prefix
length. The actual prefix is set using ip-address field. For example,
to configure a lease for prefix 2001:db8:abcd::/48, the following
command can be used:

</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "command": "lease6-add",
    "arguments": {
        "subnet-id": 66,
        "type": "IA_PD",
        "ip-address": "2001:db8:abcd::",
        "prefix-len": 48,
        "duid": "1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f:20:21:22:23:24",
        "iaid": 1234
    }
}</pre><p>

          the lease database. There are two types of parameters this command
          supports, similar to leaseX-get commands: (address) for both v4 and
          v6, (subnet-id, identifier-type, identifier) for v4 and (subnet-id,
          identifier-type, identifier, type, IAID) for v6. The first type of
          query is used when the address (either IPv4 or IPv6) is known, but the
          details of the lease are not. One common use case of this type of query
          is to remove a lease (e.g. you want a specific address to no longer be
          used, no matter who may use it). The second query uses
          identifiers. For maximum flexibility, this interface uses identifiers
          as a pair of values: type and the actual identifier. Currently
          supported identifiers are "hw-address" (IPv4 only), "client-id"
          (IPv4 only) and "duid" (IPv6 only), but additional types may be added
          in the future. </p><p>
            An example command for deleting a host reservation by address looks

          </p><p><span class="command"><strong>leaseX-del</strong></span> returns a result that
          indicates a outcome of the operation. It has one of the
          following values: 0 (success), 1 (error) or 3 (empty). The
          empty result means that a query has been completed properly,
          but the object (a lease in this case) has not been found.

          It defaults to false, which indicates that the lease is not created
          if it doesn't exist. In such case, an error is returned as a result
          of trying to update a non-existing lease. If the "force-create" parameter
          is set to true and the updated lease doesn't exist, the new lease is

          This section describes a hook application that offers a number of new
          commands used to query and manipulate subnet and shared network
          configurations in Kea.  This application is very useful in deployments
          with a large number of subnets being managed by the DHCP servers and
          when the subnets are frequently updated. The commands offer
          lightweight approach for manipulating subnets without a need to fully
          reconfigure the server and without affecting existing servers'
          configurations. An ability to manage shared networks (listing,
          retrieving details, adding new ones, removing existing ones, adding
          subnets to and removing from shared networks) is also provided.

          This command is used to create and add new subnet to the existing
          server configuration. This operation has no impact on other
          subnets. The subnet identifier must be specified and must be
          unique among all subnets. If the identifier or a subnet prefix is
          not unique an error is reported and the subnet is not added.
        </p><p>
          The subnet information within this command has the same structure
          as the subnet information in the server configuration file with the
          exception that static host reservations must not be specified
          within <span class="command"><strong>subnet6-add</strong></span>. The commands described in

          It is recommended, but not mandatory to specify subnet
          id. If not specified, Kea will try to assign the next
          subnet-id value. This automatic ID value generator is
          simple. It returns a previously automatically assigned value
          increased by 1. This works well, unless you manually create
          a subnet with a value bigger than previously used. For
          example, if you call subnet4-add five times, each without
          id, Kea will assign IDs: 1,2,3,4 and 5 and it will work just
          fine. However, if you try to call subnet4-add five times,
          with the first subnet having subnet-id of value 3 and
          remaining ones having no subnet-id, it will fail. The first
          command (with explicit value) will use subnet-id 3, the
          second command will create a subnet with id of 1, the third
          will use value of 2 and finally the fourth will have the
          subnet-id value auto-generated as 3. However, since there is
          already a subnet with that id, it will fail.
        </p><p>
          The general recommendation is to either: never use explicit
          values (so the auto-generated values will always work) or
          always use explicit values (so the auto-generation is never
          used). You can mix those two approaches only if you
          understand how the internal automatic subnet-id generation works.

          This command is used to remove a subnet from the server's configuration.
          This command has no effect on other configured subnets but removing
          a subnet has certain implications which the server's administrator
          should be aware of.
        </p><p>
          In most cases the server has assigned some leases to the clients
          belonging to the subnet. The server may also be configured with
          static host reservations which are associated with this subnet.
          The current implementation of the <span class="command"><strong>subnet4-del</strong></span>
          removes neither the leases nor host reservations associated with
          a subnet. This is the safest approach because the server doesn't
          loose track of leases assigned to the clients from this subnet.
          However, removal of the subnet may still cause configuration
          errors and conflicts. For example: after removal of the subnet,
          the server administrator may add a new subnet with the ID used
          previously for the removed subnet. This means that the existing
          leases and static reservations will be in conflict with this
          new subnet. Thus, we recommend that this command is used with extreme
          caution.

          This command can also be used to completely delete an IPv4 subnet that

          These commands are used to add a new shared network. New
          network has to have unique name. This command requires one parameter
          <span class="command"><strong>shared-networks</strong></span>, which is a list and
          should contain exactly one entry that defines the
          network. The only mandatory element for a network is its
          name. Although it does not make operational sense, it is
          allowed to add an empty shared network that does not have
          any subnets in it. That is allowed for testing purposes, but
          having empty networks (or with only one subnet) is
          discouraged in production environments. For details regarding

          An example that showcases how to add a new IPv4 shared network looks

Assuming there was no shared network with a name floor13 and no subnets with id

          These commands are used to delete existing shared
          networks. Both commands take exactly one parameter 'name' that
          specifies the name of the network to be removed. An example invocation

        </p><p>If there are any subnets belonging to the shared network

        one of two possible values: <span class="command"><strong>keep</strong></span> (which is
        the default) and <span class="command"><strong>delete</strong></span>. It controls
        whether the subnets be demoted to plain subnets or removed. An

          These commands are used to add existing subnets to existing shared
          networks. There are several ways to add new shared network. System
          administrator can add the whole shared network at once, either by
          editing a configuration file or by calling
          <span class="command"><strong>network4-add</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>network6-add</strong></span>
          commands with desired subnets in it. This approach works better for completely
          new shared subnets. However, there may be cases when an existing
          subnet is running out of addresses and needs to be extended with
          additional address space. In other words another subnet has to be
          added on top of it. For this scenario, a system administrator can use
          <span class="command"><strong>network4-add</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>network6-add</strong></span> and
          then add existing subnet to this newly created shared network  using
          <span class="command"><strong>network4-subnet-add</strong></span> or
          <span class="command"><strong>network6-subnet-add</strong></span>.
        </p><p>
          The <span class="command"><strong>network4-subnet-add</strong></span> and
          <span class="command"><strong>network6-subnet-add</strong></span> commands take two parameters:
          <span class="command"><strong>id</strong></span>, which is an integer and specifies subnet-id of existing subnet to
          be added to a shared network; and <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>, which
          specifies name of the shared network the subnet will be added to. The
          subnet must not belong to any existing network. In case you want to
          reassign a subnet from one shared network to another, please use
          <span class="command"><strong>network4-subnet-del</strong></span> or
          <span class="command"><strong>network6-subnet-del</strong></span> commands first.
        </p><p>
          An example invocation of <span class="command"><strong>network4-subnet-add</strong></span>
          command looks as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "command": "network4-subnet-add",
    "arguments": {
        "name": "floor13",
        "id": 5
    }
}</pre><p>
Assuming there is a network named 'floor13', there is a subnet with subnet-id 5
and it is not a part of existing network, the command will return a response
similar to the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "result": 0,
    "text": "IPv4 subnet 10.0.0.0/8 (id 5) is now part of shared network 'floor1'"

          These commands are used to remove a subnet that is part of existing shared
          network and demote it to a plain, stand-alone subnet. If you want to
          remove a subnet completely, use <span class="command"><strong>subnet4-del</strong></span> or
          <span class="command"><strong>subnet6-del</strong></span> commands instead.
          The <span class="command"><strong>network4-subnet-del</strong></span> and
          <span class="command"><strong>network6-subnet-del</strong></span> commands take two parameters:
          <span class="command"><strong>id</strong></span>, which is an integer and specifies subnet-id of
          existing subnet to be removed from a shared network; and
          <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>, which specifies name of the shared network
          the subnet will be removed from.
        </p><p>An example invocation of the
        <span class="command"><strong>network4-subnet-del</strong></span> command looks as follows:
 </p><pre class="screen">
 {
    "command": "network4-subnet-del",
    "arguments": {
        "name": "floor13",
        "id": 5
    }
 }</pre><p>
 Assuming there was a subnet with subnet-id equal to 5 that was part of a shared
 network named 'floor13', the response would look similar to the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "result": 0,
    "text": "IPv4 subnet 10.0.0.0/8 (id 5) is now removed from shared network 'floor13'"
}</pre><p>
The <span class="command"><strong>network6-subnet-del</strong></span> command uses exactly the same syntax for
both the command and the response.

        This section describes the High Availability hooks library, which can be
        loaded on a pair of DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 servers to increase reliability of
        the DHCP service in case of outage of one of the servers. This library
        is only available to ISC customers.
      </p><p>
        High Availability (HA) of the DHCP service is provided by running multiple
        cooperating server instances. If any of these instances becomes
        unavailable for whatever reason (DHCP software crash, Control Agent
        software crash, power outage, hardware failure), a surviving
        server instance can continue providing the reliable service to the clients. Many
        DHCP servers implementations include "DHCP Failover" protocol, which most
        significant features are: communication between the servers, partner
        failure detection and leases synchronization between the servers.
        However, the DHCPv4 failover standardization process was never completed
        at IETF. The DHCPv6 failover standard (RFC 8156) was published, but it
        is complex, difficult to use, has significant operational constraints
        and is different than its v4 counterpart.
        Although it may be useful for some users to use a "standard" failover
        protocol, it seems that most of the Kea users are simply interested in
        a working solution which guarantees high availability of the DHCP
        service. Therefore, Kea HA hook library derives major concepts from the
        DHCP Failover protocol but uses its own solutions for communication,
        configuration and its own state machine, which greatly simplifies its
        implementation and generally better fits into Kea. Also, it provides the
        same features in both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. This document purposely
        uses the term "High Availability" rather than "Failover" to emphasize that
        it is not the Failover protocol implementation.
      </p><p>
        The following sections describe the configuration and operation of the Kea
        HA hook library.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp58963248"></a>14.4.7.1.Â Supported Configurations</h4></div></div></div><p>The Kea HA hook library supports two configurations also known as HA
        modes: load balancing and hot standby. In the load balancing mode, there
        are two servers responding to the DHCP requests. The load balancing function
        is implemented as described in RFC3074, with each server responding to
        1/2 of received DHCP queries. When one of the servers allocates a lease
        for a client, it notifies the partner server over the control channel
        (RESTful API), so as the partner can save the lease information in its
        own database. If the communication with the partner is unsuccessful,
        the DHCP query is dropped and the response is not returned to the DHCP
        client. If the lease update is successful, the response is returned to
        the DHCP client by the server which has allocated the lease. By
        exchanging the lease updates, both servers get a copy of all leases
        allocated by the entire HA setup and any of the servers can be switched
        to handle the entire DHCP traffic if its partner becomes unavailable.</p><p>In the load balancing configuration, one of the servers must be
        designated as "primary" and the other server is designated as "secondary".
        Functionally, there is no difference between the two during the normal
        operation. This distniction is required when the two servers are
        started at (nearly) the same time and have to synchronize their
        lease databases. The primary server synchronizes the database first.
        The secondary server waits for the primary server to complete the
        lease database synchronization before it starts the synchronization.
        </p><p>In the hot standby configuration one of the servers is designated as
        "primary" and the second server is designated as "secondary". During the
        normal operation, the primary server is the only one that responds to
        the DHCP requests. The secodary server receives lease updates from the
        primary over the control channel. However, it does not respond to any
        DHCP queries as long as the primary is running or, more accurately,
        until the secondary considers the primary to be offline. When the
        secondary server detects the failure of the primary, it starts
        responding to all DHCP queries.
        </p><p>In the configurations described above, the primary, secondary and
        standby are referred to as "active" servers, because they receive
        lease updates and can automatically react to the partner's failures by
        responding to the DHCP queries which would normally be handled by the
        partner. The HA hook library supports another server type (role) -
        backup server. The use of the backup servers is optional. They can be used
        in both load balancing and hot standby setup, in addition to the active
        servers. There is no limit on the number of backup servers in the HA
        setup. However, the presence of the backup servers increases latency
        of the DHCP responses, because not only do active servers send lease
        updates to each other, but also to the backup servers.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp58967904"></a>14.4.7.2.Â Server States</h4></div></div></div><p>The DHCP server operating within an HA setup runs a state machine
        and the state of the server can be retrieved by its peers using the
        <span class="command"><strong>ha-heartbeat</strong></span> command sent over the RESTful API. If
        the partner server doesn't respond to the <span class="command"><strong>ha-heartbeat</strong></span>
        command longer than configured amount of time, the communication is
        considered interrupted and the server may (depending on the configuration)
        use additional measures (desribed further in this document) to verify if
        the partner is still operating. If it finds that the partner is not
        operating, the server transitions to the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span>
        state to handle the entire DHCP traffic directed to the system.</p><p>In this case, the surviving server continues to send the
        <span class="command"><strong>ha-heartbeat</strong></span> command to detect when the partner wakes
        up. The partner synchronizes the lease database and when it is finally
        ready to operate, the surviving server returns to the normal operation,
        i.e. <span class="command"><strong>load-balancing</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>hot-standby</strong></span>
        state.</p><p>The following is the list of all possible states into which the
        servers may transition:

          the active server running in the hot standby mode. Both primary and
          standby server are in this state during their normal operation.
          The primary server is responding to the DHCP queries and sends lease updates
          to the standby server and to the backup servers, if any backup servers
          are present.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>load-balancing</strong></span> - normal operation
          of the active server running in the load balancing mode. Both primary
          and secondary server are in this state during their normal operation.
          Both servers are responding to the DHCP queries and send lease updates
          to each other and to the backup servers, if any backup servers are
          present.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span> - an active server
          transitions to this state after detecting that its partner (another
          active server) is offline. The server doesn't transition to this state
          if any of the backup servers is unavailable. In the <span class="command"><strong>
          partner-down</strong></span> state the server responds to all DHCP queries,
          so also those queries which are normally handled by the active server
          which is now unavailable.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>ready</strong></span> - an active server transitions
          to this state after synchronizing its lease database with an active

          <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span> state that it may return to the
          normal operation. When it does, the server being in the <span class="command"><strong>

          transitions to this state to fetch leases from the active partner

          service of the partner from which the leases are fetched. The DHCP
          servie is disabled for the maximum time of 60 seconds, after which
          it is automatically enabled, in case the syncing partner has died
          again failing to re-enable the service. If the synchronization is
          completed the syncing server issues the <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-enable
          </strong></span> to re-enable the DHCP service of the partner. The
          syncing operation is synchronous. The server is waiting for an
          answer from the partner and is not doing anything else while the
          leases synchronization takes place.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>waiting</strong></span> - each started server
          instance enters this state. The backup server will transition
          directly from this state to the <span class="command"><strong>backup</strong></span> state.
          An active server will send heartbeat to its partner to check its
          state. If the partner appears to be unavailable the server will
          transition to the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span>, otherwise it
          will transition to the <span class="command"><strong>syncing</strong></span> state and attempt
          to synchronize the lease database. If both servers appear to be
          in this state (concurrent startup) the primary server will
          synchronize first. The secondary or standby server will remain
          in the <span class="command"><strong>waiting</strong></span> state until the primary

        </p><p>The DHCP service scopes require some explanation. The HA
        configuration must specify a unique name for each server within
        the HA setup. This document uses the following convention within
        provided examples: <span class="command"><strong>server1</strong></span> for a primary server,
        <span class="command"><strong>server2</strong></span> for the secondary or standby server and
        <span class="command"><strong>server3</strong></span> for the backup server. In the real life
        any names can be used as long as they remain unique.</p><p>In the load balancing mode there are two scopes named after
        the active servers: <span class="command"><strong>ha_server1</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>
        ha_server2</strong></span>. The DHCP queries load balanced to the
        <span class="command"><strong>server1</strong></span> belong to the <span class="command"><strong>ha_server1</strong></span>
        scope and the queries load balanced to the <span class="command"><strong>server2</strong></span>
        belong to the <span class="command"><strong>ha_server2</strong></span> scope. If any of the
        servers is in the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span> state, it is
        responsible for serving both scopes.</p><p>In the hot standby mode, there is only one scope <span class="command"><strong>
        ha_server1</strong></span> because only the <span class="command"><strong>server1</strong></span>
        is responding to the DHCP queries. If that server becomes unavailable,
        the <span class="command"><strong>server2</strong></span> becomes responsible for this scope.
        </p><p>The backup servers do not have their own scopes. In some
        cases they can be used to respond to the queries belonging to
        the scopes of the active servers. Also, a server which is neither
        in the partner-down state nor in the normal operation serves
        no scopes.</p><p>The scope names can be used to associate pools, subnets
        and networks with certain servers, so as only these servers
        can allocate addresses or prefixes from those pools, subnets
        or network. This is done via the client classification mechanism
        (see below).</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ha-scope-transition"></a>14.4.7.3.Â Scope Transition in Partner Down Case</h4></div></div></div><p>When one of the servers finds that its partner is unavailble,
        it will start serving clients from its own scope and the scope of the
        partner which is considered unavailable. This is straight forward
        for the new clients, i.e. sending DHCPDISCOVER (DHCPv4) or Solicit
        (DHCPv6), because those requests are not sent to any particular server.
        The available server will respond to all such queries when it is
        in the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span> state.</p><p>When the client is renewing a lease, it will send its
        DHCPREQUEST (DHCPv4) or Renew (DHCPv6) message directly to the
        server which has allocated the lease being renewed. Because this
        server is unavailable, the client will not get any response. In
        that case, the client continues to use its lease and re-tries to
        renew until the rebind timer (T2) elapses. The client will now enter
        the rebinding phase, in which it will send DHCPREQUEST (DHCPv4) or
        Rebind (DHCPv6) message to any available server. The surviving
        server will receive the rebinding request and will (typically)
        extend the lifetime of the lease. The client will continue to
        contact that new server to renew its lease as appropriate.</p><p>When the other server becomes available, both active servers
        will eventually transition to the <span class="command"><strong>load-balancing</strong></span>
        or <span class="command"><strong>hot-standby</strong></span> state, in which they will be
        responsible for their own scopes. Some clients belonging to the
        scope of the started server will be trying to renew their leases
        via the surviving server. This server will not respond to them
        anymore and the client will eventually transition back to the
        right server via rebinding mechanism again.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ha-load-balancing-config"></a>14.4.7.4.Â Load Balancing Configuration</h4></div></div></div><p>The following is the configuration snippet which enables

        remote servers. In the example provided above, it is assumed that
        Kea libraries are installed in the <code class="filename">/usr/lib</code>
        directory. If Kea is not installed in the /usr directory, the
        hook libraries locations must be updated accordingly.
        </p><p>The HA configuration is specified within the scope of the
        <code class="filename">libdhcp_ha.so</code>. Note that the top level
        parameter <span class="command"><strong>high-availability</strong></span> is a list, even
        though it currently contains only one entry. In the future this
        configuration is likely to be extended to contain more entries,
        if the particular server can participate in more than one
        HA relationships.</p><p>The following are the global parameters which control the server's
        behavior with respect to HA:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>this-server-name</strong></span> - is a unique
          identifier of the server within this HA setup. It must match with one
          of the servers specified within <span class="command"><strong>peers</strong></span> list.
          </p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>mode</strong></span> - specifies a HA mode
          of operation. Currently supported modes are <span class="command"><strong>load-balancing
          </strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>hot-standby</strong></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>heartbeat-delay</strong></span> - specifies
          a duration in milliseconds between the last heartbeat (or other command sent
          to the partner) and sending the next heartbeat. The heartbeats are sent
          periodically to gather the status of the partner and to verify whether
          the partner is still operating. The default value of this parameter is
          10000 ms.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>max-response-delay</strong></span> - specifies a
          duration in milliseconds since the last successful communication with the
          partner, after which the server assumes that the communication with
          the partner is interrupted. This duration should be greater than
          the <span class="command"><strong>heartbeat-delay</strong></span>. Usually it is a greater than
          the duration of multiple <span class="command"><strong>heartbeat-delay</strong></span> values.
          When the server detects that the communication is interrupted, it
          may transition to the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span> state (when
          <span class="command"><strong>max-unacked-clients</strong></span> is 0) or trigger failure
          detection procedure using the values of the two parameters below.
          The default value of this parameter is 60000.
          </p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>max-ack-delay</strong></span> - is one of
          the parameters controlling partner failure detection. When the
          communication with the partner is interrupted, the server examines values
          of the <span class="command"><strong>secs</strong></span> field (DHCPv4) or <span class="command"><strong>Elapsed Time
          </strong></span> option (DHCPv6) which denote how long the DHCP client has been
          trying to communicate with the DHCP server. This parameter specifies the
          maximum time in milliseconds for the client to try to communicate with the
          DHCP server, after which this server assumes that the client failed to
          communicate with the DHCP server (is "unacked"). The default value of
          this parameter is 10000.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>max-unacked-clients</strong></span> - specifies
          how many "unacked" clients are allowed (see <span class="command"><strong>max-ack-delay</strong></span>)
          before this server assumes that the partner is offline and transitions
          to the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span> state. The special value of 0
          is allowed for this parameter which disables failure detection
          mechanism. In this case, the server which can't communicate with the
          partner over the control channel assumes that the partner server is
          down and transitions to the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span> state
          immediately. The default value of this parameter is 10.</p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>
          The values of <span class="command"><strong>max-ack-delay</strong></span> and
          <span class="command"><strong>max-unacked-clients</strong></span> must be selected carefully, taking
          into account specifics of the network in which DHCP servers are
          operating. Note that the server in question may not respond to some
          of the DHCP clients because these clients are not to be serviced
          by this server (per administrative policy). The server may also
          drop malformed queries from the clients. Therefore, selecting too
          low value for the <span class="command"><strong>max-unacked-clients</strong></span> may
          result in transitioning to the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span>
          state even though the partner is still operating. On the other
          hand, selecting too high value may result in never transitioning
          to the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down</strong></span> state if the DHCP
          traffic in the network is very low (e.g. night time), because the
          number of distinct clients trying to communicate with the server
          could be lower than <span class="command"><strong>max-unacked-clients</strong></span>.
        </p><p>In some cases it may be useful to disable the failure detection
        mechanism altogether, if the servers are located very close to each
        other and the network partitioning is unlikely, i.e. failure to
        respond to heartbeats is only possible when the partner is offline.
        In such cases, set the <span class="command"><strong>max-unacked-clients</strong></span> to 0.
        </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>peers</strong></span> parameter contains a list of servers
        within this HA setup. In this configuration it must contain at least
        one primary and one secondary server. It may also contain unlimited
        number of backup servers. In this example there is one backup server
        which receives lease updates from the active servers.</p><p>There are the following parameters specified for each of the
        peers within this list:

        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> - specifies unique name for
          the server.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>url</strong></span> - specifies URL to be used to
          contact this server over the control channel. Other servers use this
          URL to send control commands to that server.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>role</strong></span> - denotes the role of the
          server in the HA setup. The following roles are supported in the
          load balancing configuration: <span class="command"><strong>primary</strong></span>,
          <span class="command"><strong>secondary</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>backup</strong></span>.
          There must be exactly one primary and one secondary server in the
          load balancing setup.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p><span class="command"><strong>auto-failover</strong></span> - a boolean value
          which denotes whether the server detecting a partner's failure should
          automatically start serving partner's clients. The default value of
          this parameter is true.</p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>In our example configuration, both active servers can allocate
        leases from the subnet "192.0.3.0/24". This subnet contains two
        address pools: "192.0.3.100 - 192.0.3.150" and "192.0.3.200 - 192.0.3.250",
        which are associated with HA servers scopes using client classification.
        When the <span class="command"><strong>server1</strong></span> processes a DHCP query it will use
        the first pool for the lease allocation. Conversely, when the
        <span class="command"><strong>server2</strong></span> is processing the DHCP query it will use the
        second pool. When any of the servers is in the <span class="command"><strong>partner-down
        </strong></span> state, it can serve leases from both pools and it will
        select the pool which is appropriate for the received query. In
        other words, if the query would normally be processed by the
        <span class="command"><strong>server2</strong></span>, but this server is not available, the
        <span class="command"><strong>server1</strong></span> will allocate the lease from the pool of
        "192.0.3.200 - 192.0.3.250".

        the load balancing configuration with the client classification limited
        to the use of <span class="command"><strong>ha_server1</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>ha_server2</strong></span>
        classes, which are dynamically assigned to the received DHCP queries.
        In many cases it will be required to use HA in deployments which already
        use some client classification.
        </p><p>
          Suppose there is a system which classifies devices into two groups:
          phones and laptops, based on some classification criteria specified in
          Kea configuration file. Both types of devices are allocated leases
          from different address pools. Introducing HA in the load balancing mode
          is expected to result in further split of each of those pools, so as
          each of the servers can allocate leases for some part of the phones
          and part of the laptops. This requires that each of the existing pools
          should be split between the <span class="command"><strong>ha_server1</strong></span> and
          <span class="command"><strong>ha_server2</strong></span>, so we end up with the following classes:

        </p><p>This configuration is very similar to the load balancing

        with a few notable differences.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>mode</strong></span> is now set to <span class="command"><strong>hot-standby</strong></span>,
        in which only one server is responding to the DHCP clients.
        If the primary server is online, the primary server is responding to
        all DHCP queries. The <span class="command"><strong>standby</strong></span> server takes over the
        entire DHCP traffic when it discovers that the primary is unavailable.
        </p><p>In this mode, the non-primary active server is called
        <span class="command"><strong>standby</strong></span> and that's what the role of the second
        active server is set to.</p><p>Finally, because there is always one server responding to the
        DHCP queries, there is only one scope <span class="command"><strong>ha_server1</strong></span>
        in use within pools definitions. In fact, the <span class="command"><strong>client-class</strong></span>
        parameter could be removed from this configuration without harm,
        because there are no conflicts in lease allocations by different
        servers as they do not allocate leases concurrently. The
        <span class="command"><strong>client-class</strong></span> is left in this example mostly for
        demonstration purposes, to highlight the differences between the
        hot standby and load balancing mode of operation.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ha-send-lease-updates"></a>14.4.7.7.Â Controlling Lease Updates</h4></div></div></div><p>The HA enabled server informs its active partner about allocated
        or renewed leases by sending appropriate control commands. The partner
        updates the lease information in its own database. This guarantees
        consistency of the lease information between the servers and allows for
        designating one of the servers to handle the entire DHCP traffic in
        case the other server becomes unavailable.</p><p>In some cases, though, it is desired to disable lease updates
        between the active servers if the exchange of information about the
        allocated leases is performed using some other mechanism. Kea supports
        various types of databases to be used as a storage for leases, e.g.
        MySQL, Postgres, Cassandra. Those databases include builtin solutions
        for data replication which are often used by Kea users to provide
        redundancy.</p><p>The HA hook library supports such scenarios by allowing to
        disable lease updates over the control channel, leaving the server
        to rely on the database replication mechanism. This is controlled by
        the <span class="command"><strong>send-lease-updates</strong></span> boolean parameter, which
        value defaults to true:

        The same functionality is used by High Availability hook library to

        instance within HA setup. If the Control Agent is not started
        the peers will not be able to communicate with the particular DHCP
        server (even if the DHCP server itself is online) and may eventually
        consider this server to be offline.

          updates those locally stored leases which are older comparing to
          those fetched. It also creates new leases when any of those
          fetched do not exist in the local database. All leases that
          are not returned by the peer but are in the local database are
          preserved. The database synchronization is unidirectional, i.e.
          only the database on the server to which the command has been
          sent is updated. In order to synchronize the peer's database a
          separate <span class="command"><strong>ha-sync</strong></span> has to be issued to that
          peer.</p><p>The database synchronization may be triggered for
          both active and backup server type. The <span class="command"><strong>ha-sync</strong></span>
          has the following structure (DHCPv4 server case):
</p><pre class="screen">

          </p><p>
            When the server receives this command it first disables the
            DHCP service of the server from which it will be fetching leases,
            i.e. sends <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-disable</strong></span> command to that server.
            The <span class="command"><strong>max-period</strong></span> parameter specifies the maximum
            duration (in seconds) for which the DHCP service should be disabled.
            If the DHCP service is successfully disabled, the synchronizing
            server will fetch leases from the remote server by issuing the
            <span class="command"><strong>lease4-get-all</strong></span> command. When the lease database
            synchronization is complete, the synchronizing server sends the
            <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-enable</strong></span> to the peer to re-enable its
            DHCP service.
          </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>max-period</strong></span> value should be sufficiently

          is completed. Otherwise, the DHCP server will automatically enable
          its DHCP function while the synchronization is still in progress.
          If the DHCP server subsequently allocates any leases during the
          synchronization, those new (or updated) leases will not be fetched
          by the synchronizing server leading to database inconsistencies.

    The RADIUS hook library allows Kea to interact with two types of
    RADIUS servers: access and accounting. Although the most common
    DHCP and RADIUS integration is done on DHCP relay agent level
    (DHCP clients send DHCP packets to DHCP relays; relays contact
    RADIUS server and depending on the response either send the packet
    to the DHCP server or drop it), it does require a DHCP relay
    hardware to support RADIUS communication. Also, even if the relay
    has necessary support it is often not flexible enough to send and
    receive additional RADIUS attributes. As such, the alternative
    looks more appealing: to extend DHCP server to talk to RADIUS
    directly. That is the goal this library intends to fulfill.
  </p><p>
    The major feature of the library is the ability to use RADIUS
    authorization. When a DHCP packet is received, the Kea server
    will send send Access-Request to the RADIUS server and will await
    a response. The server will then send back either Access-Accept
    with specific client attributes or Access-Reject. There are two
    cases supported here. First, the Access-Accept includes
    Framed-IP-Address (for DHCPv4) or Framed-IPv6-Address (for
    DHCPv6), which will be interpreted by Kea as an instruction to
    assign that specified IPv4 or IPv6 address. This effectively
    means RADIUS can act as address reservation database.
  </p><p>
    The second case supported is the ability to assign clients to
    specific pools based on RADIUS response. In this case RADIUS
    server sends back Access-Accept with Framed-Pool (IPv4) or
    Framed-IPv6-Pool (IPv6). In both cases, Kea will interpret those
    attributes as client classes. With the recent addition of the
    ability to limit access to pools to specific classes (see <a class="xref" href="#classification-pools" title="13.7.Â Configuring Pools With Class Information">SectionÂ 13.7, âConfiguring Pools With Class Informationâ</a>), it can be used to force client
    to be assigned a dynamic address from specific pool. Furthermore,
    the same mechanism can be used to control what kind of options the
    client will get (if there are DHCP options specified for a
    particular class).
  </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="hooks-radius-install"></a>14.4.8.1.Â Compilation and Installation of RADIUS Hook</h4></div></div></div><p>
      The following section describes how to compile and install the
      software on CentOS 7.0. Other systems may differ slightly.
    </p><p>
      STEP 1: Install dependencies
    </p><p>
      Several tools are needed to build dependencies and Kea
      itself. The following commands should install them:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ sudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
$ sudo yum install gcc-g++ openssl-devel log4cplus-devel wget git
</pre><p>
    </p><p>
      STEP 2: FreeRADIUS installation.
    </p><p>
      Kea RADIUS hook library uses FreeRadius client library to
      conduct RADIUS communication. Unfortunately, the standard
      1.1.7 release available from the project website
      <code class="uri"><a class="uri" href="http://freeradius.org/sub_projects/" target="_top">http://freeradius.org/sub_projects/</a></code>
      has several serious deficiencies. ISC engineers observed a segmentation
      fault during testing. Also, the base version of the library does
      not offer asynchronous transmissions, which is essential for
      effective accounting implementation. Both of these issues
      were addressed by ISC engineers. The changes have been
      reported to FreeRadius client project. Acceptance of those
      changes is outside of ISC responsibilities. Until those
      are processed, it is strongly recommended to use FreeRadius
      client with ISC patches. To and compile this version, please use
      the following steps:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ git clone https://github.com/fxdupont/freeradius-client.git
$ cd freeradius-client/
$ git checkout iscdev
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre><p>

      You may pass additional parameters to configure script, if you need
      to. Once installed, the FreeRADIUS client will be installed in
      /usr/local. This is the default path where Kea will be looking for
      it. You may install it in a different directory. If you choose to do
      so, make sure you pass that path to configure script when compiling kea.
      </p><p>
        STEP 3: Install recent BOOST version
      </p><p>
        Kea requires reasonably recent Boost version. Unfortunately,
        the version available in CentOS 7 is too old. Therefore a
        newer Boost version is necessary. Furthermore, CentOS 7 has an
        old version of g++ compiler that does not handle latest Boost
        versions. Fortunately, Boost 1.65 meets both requirements: is
        recent enough for Kea and is still able to be compiled using
        the g++ 4.8 version in CentOS.
      </p><p>
        To download and compile Boost 1.65, please use the following
        commands:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ wget -nd https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.65.1/source/boost_1_65_1.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf boost_1_65_1.tar.gz
$ cd boost_1_65_1/
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./b2 --without-python
$ sudo ./b2 install
</pre><p>
        Note that b2 script may optionally take extra parameters. One
        of them specify the destination path where the sources are to
        be compiled. Boost is different compared to other software in
        the sense that there is no explicit make install step.
      </p><p>
        STEP 4: Compile and Install Kea
      </p><p>
        Obtain Kea sources either by downloading it from git repository or extract the tarball:
</p><pre class="screen">
# Use one of those commands to obtain Kea sources:

# Choice 1: get from github
$ git clone https://github.com/isc-projects/kea

# Get a tarball and extract it
$ tar zxvf kea-1.4.0-beta.tar.gz
</pre><p>

The next step is to extract premium Kea package that contains Radius repository
into the Kea sources. After the tarball is extracted, the Kea sources should have
a premium/ subdirectory.

</p><pre class="screen">
  $ cd kea
  $ tar zxvf ../kea-premium-radius-1.4.0-beta.tar.gz
</pre><p>

Once this is done, make sure the kea sources look similar to this:
</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>

The next step is to configure Kea. There are several essential steps necessary here.
The --with-tier2=yes flag is necessary to compile premium package that contains
RADIUS. Also, --with-freeradius option is necessary to tell Kea where the FreeRADIUS
client sources can be found. Also, since the non-standard boost is used, the path
to it has to be specified.</p><p>If the sources are not from a tarball release, makefiles have to be regenerated
using autoreconf.</p><pre class="screen">
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure --with-freeradius=/path/to/freeradius --with-boost-include=/path/to/boost --with-boost-lib-dir=/path/to/boost/state/lib
</pre><p>
For example, assuming FreeRadius client was installed in the default directory (/usr/local)
and Boost 1.65 sources were compiled in /home/thomson/devel/boost1_65_1, the configure path
should look as follows:</p><pre class="screen">
./configure --with-freeradius=/usr/local \
            --with-boost-include=/home/thomson/devel/boost_1_65_1 \
            --with-boost-lib-dir=/home/thomson/devel/boost_1_65_1/stage/lib \
            --with-tier2=yes
</pre><p>
  After some checks, the configure script should print a report similar to the
  following:

      Radius is a complicated environment. As such, it's not really possible
      to provide a default configuration that would work out of the box.
      However, we do have one example that showcases some of the more
      common features. Please see doc/examples/kea4/hooks-radius.json in your
      Kea sources.
    </p><p>
      The RADIUS hook library supports the following global configuration
      flags, which corresponds to FreeRADIUS client library options:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>bindaddr</strong></span> (default "*") specifies
        the address to be used by the hook library in communication with RADIUS
        servers. The "*" special value means to leave the kernel to choose
        it.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>canonical-mac-address</strong></span> (default
      false) specifies whether MAC addresses in attributes follows the canonical
      Radius format (lowercase pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by
      '-').</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>client-id-pop0</strong></span> (default false) used
      with flex-id removes the leading zero (or pair of zero in DHCPv6) type in
      client-id (aka duid in DHCPv6). Implied by
      client-id-printable.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>client-id-printable</strong></span> (default false)
      checks if the client-id / duid content is printable and uses it as it
      instead of in hexadecimal.  Implies client-id-pop0 and extract-duid as 0
      and 255 are not printable.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>deadtime</strong></span> (default 0) is a mechanism
      to try not responding servers after responding servers. Its value
      specifies the number of seconds the fact a server did not answer is kept,
      so 0 disables the mechanism.  As the asynchronous communication does not
      use locks or atomics it is not recommended to use this feature with this
      mode. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>dictionary</strong></span> (default set by configure
      at build time) is the attribute and value dictionary. Note it is a
      critical parameter. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>extract-duid</strong></span> (default true) extracts
      from RFC 4361 compliant DHCPv4 client-id the embedded duid. Implied by
      client-id-printable. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>identifier-type4</strong></span> (default client-id)
      specifies the identifier type to build the User-Name attribute. It should
      be the same than host identifier and when the flex-id hook library is
      used the replace-client-id must be set to true and client-id will be used
      with client-id-pop0. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>identifier-type6</strong></span> (default duid)
      specifies the identifier type to build the User-Name attribute. It should
      be the same than host identifier and when the flex-id hook librairy is
      used the replace-client-id must be set to true and duid will be used with
      client-id-pop0. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>realm</strong></span> (default "") is the default
      realm. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>reselect-subnet-address</strong></span> (default
      false) uses the Kea reserved address / RADIUS Framed-IP-Address or
      Framed-IPv6-Address to reselect subnets where the address is not in
      the subnet range. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>reselect-subnet-pool</strong></span> (default
      false) uses the Kea client-class / RADIUS Frame-Pool to reselect
      subnets where no available pool can be found. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>retries</strong></span> (default 3) is the number of
      retries before trying the next server. Note it is not supported for
      asynchronous communication. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>session-history</strong></span> (default "") is the
      name of the file providing persistent storage for accounting session
      history. </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>timeout</strong></span> (default 10) is the number
      of seconds a response is waited for. </li></ul></div><p>

    </p><p> When <span class="command"><strong>reselect-subnet-pool</strong></span> or
    <span class="command"><strong>reselect-subnet-address</strong></span> is set to true at the
    reception of RADIUS Access-Accept the selected subnet is checked
    against the client-class name or the reserved address and if it does
    not matched another subnet is selected among matching subnets.
    </p><p>
      Two services are supported:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>access</strong></span> - the authentication service </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>accounting</strong></span> - the accounting service</li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      Configuration of services is divided into two parts:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">servers that define RADIUS servers the library is expected to

            address of the server (it is allowed to use a name which will be
            resolved but it is not recommended).</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>port</strong></span> (default RADIUS
            authentication or accounting service) which specifies the UDP port
            of the server. Note that the FreeRADIUS client library by default
            uses ports 1812 (auth) and 1813 (acct). Some server implementations
            use 1645 (auth) ns 1646 (acct). You may use the "port" parameter to
            adjust as needed.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>secret</strong></span> which authenticates

          the Kea server will send to a RADIUS server. The parameter
          must be identified either by a name or type. Its value can
          be specified using one of three possible ways: data (which
          defines a plain text value), raw (which defines the value in
          hex) or expr (which defines an expression, which will be
          evaluated for each incoming packet independently).
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> of the

            attribute may be used.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>raw</strong></span> is the second out of three
            way to specify the attribute content. It specifies the content in
            hexadecimal. Note it does not work with integer content attributes
            (date, integer and IPv4 address), a string content attribute
            (string. IPv6 address and IPv6 prefix) is
            required.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>expr</strong></span> is the last way to
            specify the attribute content. It specifies an evaluation expression
            which must return a not empty string when evaluated with the DHCP
            query packet.  Currently this is restricted to the access
            service. </li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
  For example, to specify a single access server available on localhost that
  uses "secret" as a secret and tell Kea to send three additional attributes
  (Password, Connect-Info and Configuration-Token), the following snipped could
  be used:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"parameters": {

    // Other RADIUS parameters here

    "access": {

        // This starts the list of access servers
        "servers": [
        {
            // These are parameters for the first (and only) access server
            "server": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 1812,
            "secret": "secret"
        }
        // Additional access servers could be specified here
        ],

        // This define a list of additional attributes Kea will send to each
        // access server in Access-Request.
        "attributes": [
        {
            // This attribute is identified by name (must be present in the
            // dictionary) and has static value (i.e. the same value will be
            // sent to every server for every packet)
            "name": "Password",
            "data": "mysecretpassword"
        },
        {
            // It's also possible to specify an attribute using its type,
            // rather than a name. 77 is Connect-Info. The value is specified
            // using hex. Again, this is a static value. It will be sent the
            // same for every packet and to every server.
            "type": 77,
            "raw": "65666a6a71"
        },
        {
            // This example shows how an expression can be used to send dynamic
            // value. The expression (see Section 13) may take any value from
            // the incoming packet or even its metadata (e.g. the interface

</p><p>For the RADIUS Hook library to operate properly in DHCPv4, it is necessary
to also load the Host Cache hook library. The reason for this is somewhat
complex. In a typical deployment the DHCP clients send their packets via
DHCP relay which inserts certain Relay Agent Information options, such are
circuit-id or remote-id. The values of those options are then used by the
Kea DHCP server to formulate necessary attributes in the Access-Request message
sent to the RADIUS server. However, once the DHCP client gets its address, it
then renews by sending packets directly to the DHCP server. As a result, the
relays are not able to insert their RAI options and DHCP server can't send the
Access-Request queries to the RADIUS server by using just the information from
incoming packets. Kea needs to keep the information received during initial
Discover/Offer exchanges and later use it when sending accounting
messages.</p><p>This mechanism is implemented based on user context in host reservations.
(See <a class="xref" href="#user-context" title="14.5.Â User contexts">SectionÂ 14.5, âUser contextsâ</a> for details about user context). The host
cache mechanism allows to retain the information retrieved by RADIUS to be
stored and later used for sending accounting and access queries to the RADIUS
server. In other words, the host-cache mechanism is mandatory, unless you
don't want the RADIUS communication for messages other than
Discover and the first Request from each client.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="hooks-host-cache"></a>14.4.9.Â host_cache: Caching Host Reservations</h3></div></div></div><p>Some of the database backends, such as RADIUS, are considered
  slow and may take a long time to respond. Since Kea in general is
  synchronous, the backend performance directly affects the DHCP
  performance. To minimize the impact and improve performance, the
  Host Cache library provides a way to cache responses from other
  hosts. This includes negative caching, i.e. the ability to remember
  that there is no client information in the database.</p><p>

  </p><p>
    The RADIUS Host cache is a library that has to be loaded by either
    DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 Kea servers. In principle it can be used with any
    backend that may introduce performance degradation (MySQL,
    PostgreSQL, Cassandra, RADIUS). Host Cache is required to be
    loaded for the RADIUS accounting mechanism to work.
  </p><p>
    Host Cache hook library is currently very simple. It takes only
    one optional parameter ("maximum") that defines the maximum number
    of hosts to be cached. If not specified the default value of 0 is
    used, which means there is no limit. The hook library can be
    loaded the same way as any other hook library. For example, this
    configuration could be used:

</p><pre class="screen">
  "Dhcp4": {

  // Your regular DHCPv4 configuration parameters here.

  "hooks-libraries": [
  {
      "library": "/usr/local/lib/hooks/libdhc_host_cache.so",
      "parameters": {

          // Tells Kea to never cache more than 1000 hosts.
          "maximum: "1000"

      }
  } ]</pre><p>
  </p><p>
    Once loaded, the Host Cache hook library makes available a number
    of new commands. Those commands can be used either over control
    channel (see <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel-client" title="16.2.Â Using the Control Channel">SectionÂ 16.2, âUsing the Control Channelâ</a>) or REST API
    (see <a class="xref" href="#agent-overview" title="7.1.Â Overview">SectionÂ 7.1, âOverviewâ</a>). An example REST API client
    is described in <a class="xref" href="#shell-overview" title="19.1.Â Overview">SectionÂ 19.1, âOverviewâ</a>. The following
    sections describe the commands available.

    "arguments": 1000
}</pre><p>

    state and the server can be shutdown or restarted as usual. The
    cache will then be repopulated after restart. However, there are
    some cases when it is useful to store contents of the cache. One
    such case is RADIUS (where the cached hosts also retain
    additional cached RADIUS attributes and there is no easy way to
    obtain this information again, because renewing clients send their
    packet to the DHCP server directly. As a result, packets never go
    through relay which doesn't insert relay options, which in turn
    are in some deployment to query the RADIUS server). Another use
    case is when you want to restart the server and for performance
    reasons you want it to start with a hot (populated) cache.

    host cache. A good use case is a situation where the device is up,
    Kea already provided configuration and the host entry is in
    cache. As a result of administrative action (e.g. customer hasn't
    paid their bills or perhaps been upgraded to better service), the
    information in the backend (e.g. MySQL or RADIUS) is being
    updated. However, since cache is in use, Kea does not notice the
    change as the cached values are used. Cache-remove command can
    solve this problem by removing cached entry after administrative
    changes.</p><p>
      The cache-remove command works similarly to reservation-get
      command. It allows querying by two parameters. One of them is
      either subnet-id4 or subnet-id6 and the other one is one of:
      ip-address (may be IPv4 or IPv6 address), hw-address (specifies
      hardware/MAC address), duid, circuit-id, client-id or flex-id.
    </p><p>
      An example command to remove an IPv4 host with reserved address
      192.0.2.1 from subnet with a subnet-id 123 looks as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">

      Another example that removes IPv6 host identifier by DUID and
      specific subnet-id is:
</p><pre class="screen">

    This library provides additional statistics commands for
    retrieving lease statistics from Kea DHCP servers.  These commands
    were added to address an issue with obtaining accurate lease
    statistics in deployments running multiple Kea servers that use
    shared lease back end.  The in-memory statistics kept by individual
    servers only track lease changes made by that server.  Thus in a
    deployment with multiple servers (e.g. two kea-dhcp6 servers using the
    same PostgreSQL database for lease storage), these statistics are incomplete.
    In Kea 1.4, the MySQL and PostgreSQL back ends were modified to track
    lease allocation changes as they occur via database triggers. Additionally,
    all four lease back ends were extended to support retrieving lease
    statistics for all subnets, a single subnet, or a range of subnets.
    Finally, this library was constructed to provide commands for retrieving
    these statistics.  Additional statistics commands may be added to this
    library in future releases.
  </p><p>
    The commands currently provided by this library are:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>stat-lease4-get</strong></span> - fetches DHCPv4 lease statistics</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>stat-lease6-get</strong></span> - fetches DHCPv6 lease statistics</p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    The Stat commands library is part of the open source code and is
    available to every Kea user.
  </p><p>
    All commands use JSON syntax and can be issued either directly to
    the servers via the control channel (see <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel" title="ChapterÂ 16.Â Management API">ChapterÂ 16, <i>Management API</i></a>)
    or via Control Agent (see <a class="xref" href="#kea-ctrl-agent" title="ChapterÂ 7.Â Kea Control Agent">ChapterÂ 7, <i>Kea Control Agent</i></a>).

    This library may be loaded by both kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 servers.
    It is loaded in the same way as other libraries and currently has
    no parameters:

    In a deployment with multiple Kea DHCP servers sharing a common lease
    storage, it may be loaded by any or all of the servers.  However, one
    thing to keep in mind is that a server's response to a stat-lease{4/6}-get
    command will only contain data for subnets known to that server.  In
    other words, if subnet does not appear in a server's configuration, it
    will not retrieve statistics for it.

      The <span class="command"><strong>stat-lease4-get</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>stat-lease6-get</strong></span>
      commands fetch lease statistics for a range of known subnets.  The
      range of subnets is determined through the use of optional command

            a single subnet.  If the subnet does not exist the command result
            code will be 3 (i.e. CONTROL_RESULT_EMPTY).
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>subnet-range</strong></span> - A pair of subnet IDs which
            describe an inclusive range of subnets for which statistics should
            be retrieved.  Note that fuzzy values are supported thus allowing
            for a query for statistics using approximate ID values. If the
            range does not include any known subnets, the command result code
            will be 3 (i.e. CONTROL_RESULT_EMPTY).

        The use of subnet-id and subnet-range are mutually exclusive.
        If no parameters are given, the result will contain data for all
        known subnets.  Note that in configurations with large numbers of
        subnets, this can be result in a large response.

      convenient if the parameter applies to the whole library. However,
      sometimes it is very useful if certain configuration entities are extended
      with additional configuration data. This is where the concept of user
      contexts comes in. A sysadmin can define an arbitrary set of data and
      attach it to Kea structures, as long as the data is specified as JSON map.
      In particular, it is possible to define fields that are integers, strings,
      boolean, lists and maps. It is possible to define nested structures of
      arbitrary complexity. Kea does not use that data on its own, simply stores
      and makes it available for the hook libraries.
      </p><p>
        Another use case for user contexts may be storing comments and other
        information that will be retained by Kea. Regular comments are discarded
        when configuration is loaded, but user contexts are retained. This is
        useful if you want your comments to survive config-set, config-get
        operations for example.
      </p><p>
        If user context is supported in a given context, the parser translates
        "comment" entries into user context with a "comment" entry. The pretty
        print of a configuration does the opposite operation and puts "comment"
        entries at the beginning of maps as it seems to be the common usage.
      </p><p>
        As of Kea 1.3, the structures that allow user contexts are
        pools of all types (addresses and prefixes) and subnets. Kea
        1.4 extended user context support to the global scope, interfaces config,
        shared networks, subnets, client classes, option datas and definitions,
        host reservations, control socket, dhcp ddns, loggers and server id.
        These are supported in both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 at the exception
        of server id which is DHCPv6 only.

    A working DHCP server encounters various events
    that can cause certain statistics to be collected. For
    example, a DHCPv4 server may receive a packet (pkt4-received
    statistic increases by one) that after parsing was identified as a
    DHCPDISCOVER (pkt4-discover-received). The Server processed it and
    decided to send a DHCPOFFER representing its answer (pkt4-offer-sent
    and pkt4-sent statistics increase by one). Such events happen
    frequently, so it is not uncommon for the statistics to have
    values in high thousands. They can serve as an easy and powerful
    tool for observing a server's and network's health. For example,
    if pkt4-received statistic stops growing, it means that the
    clients' packets are not reaching the server.</p><p>There are four types of statistics:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>integer</em></span> - this is the most common type.  It
        is implemented as 64 bit integer (int64_t in C++), so it can hold any
        value between -2^63 to 2^63 -1.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>floating point</em></span> - this type is intended to
        store floating point precision. It is implemented as double C++ type.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>duration</em></span> - this type is intended for
        recording time periods. It uses boost::posix_time::time_duration type,
        which stores hours, minutes, seconds and microseconds.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>string</em></span> - this type is intended for
        recording statistics in textual form. It uses std::string C++ type.
        </li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      During normal operation, DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers gather statistics.
      For a list of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 statistics, see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-stats" title="8.8.Â Statistics in the DHCPv4 Server">SectionÂ 8.8, âStatistics in the DHCPv4 Serverâ</a> and <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-stats" title="9.12.Â Statistics in the DHCPv6 Server">SectionÂ 9.12, âStatistics in the DHCPv6 Serverâ</a>, respectively.
    </p><p>
      To extract data from the statistics module, the control channel can be
      used. See <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel" title="ChapterÂ 16.Â Management API">ChapterÂ 16, <i>Management API</i></a> for details. It is possible to
      retrieve a single or all statistics, reset statistics (i.e. set to neutral
      value, typically zero) or even remove completely a single or all
      statistics. See section <a class="xref" href="#command-stats" title="15.3.Â Commands for Manipulating Statistics">SectionÂ 15.3, âCommands for Manipulating Statisticsâ</a> for a list of
      statistic oriented commands.

      It is useful to understand how the Statistics Manager module works. When
      the server starts operation, the manager is empty and does not have any
      statistics. When <span class="command"><strong>statistic-get-all</strong></span> is executed, an
      empty list is returned. Once the server performs an operation that causes
      a statistic to change, the related statistic will be created. In the general
      case, once a statistic is recorded even once, it is kept in the manager, until
      explicitly removed, by <span class="command"><strong>statistic-remove</strong></span> or
       <span class="command"><strong>statistic-remove-all</strong></span> being called or the server is shut
      down. Per subnet statistics are explicitly removed when reconfiguration
      takes place.
    </p><p>
      Statistics are considered run-time properties, so they are not retained
      after server restart.
    </p><p>
      Removing a statistic that is updated frequently makes little sense as it
      will be re-added when the server code next records that statistic.
      The <span class="command"><strong>statistic-remove</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>statistic-remove-all</strong></span> commands are intended to remove
      statistics that are not expected to be observed in the near future. For
      example, a misconfigured device in a network may cause clients to report
      duplicate addresses, so the server will report increasing values of
      pkt4-decline-received. Once the problem is found and the device is
      removed, the system administrator may want to remove the
      pkt4-decline-received statistic, so it won't be reported anymore. If a
      duplicate address is detected ever again, the server will add this
      statistic back.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="command-stats"></a>15.3.Â Commands for Manipulating Statistics</h2></div></div></div><p>
      There are several commands defined that can be used for accessing (-get),
      resetting to zero or neutral value (-reset) or even removing a statistic
      completely (-remove). The difference between reset and remove is somewhat
      subtle.  The reset command sets the value of the statistic to zero or neutral
      value. After this operation, the statistic will have a value of 0 (integer),
      0.0 (float), 0h0m0s0us (duration) or "" (string). When asked for, a statistic
      with the values mentioned will be returned. <span class="command"><strong>Remove</strong></span> removes
      a statistic completely, so the statistic will not be reported anymore. Please
      note that the server code may add it back if there's a reason to record
      it.

    the server's configuration is stored in configuration files
    and, when the configuration is changed, the daemon is restarted.
    This approach has the significant disadvantage of introducing periods
    of downtime, when client traffic is not handled. Another risk
    is that if the new configuration is invalid for whatever reason,
    the server may refuse to start, which will further extend the
    downtime period until the issue is resolved.</p><p>To avoid such problems, both the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers
    include support for a mechanism that allows
    on-line reconfiguration without requiring server shutdown.
    Both servers can be instructed to open control sockets, which
    is a communication channel. The server is able to receive
    commands on that channel, act on them and report back status.
    While the set of commands in Kea 1.2.0 is limited,
    the number is expected to grow over time.</p><p>The DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers receive commands over the
    unix domain sockets. The details how to configure these sockets,
    see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-ctrl-channel" title="8.9.Â Management API for the DHCPv4 Server">SectionÂ 8.9, âManagement API for the DHCPv4 Serverâ</a> and <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-ctrl-channel" title="9.13.Â Management API for the DHCPv6 Server">SectionÂ 9.13, âManagement API for the DHCPv6 Serverâ</a>. While it is possible control
    the servers directly using unix domain sockets it requires that
    the controlling client be running on the same machine as
    the server. In order to connect remotely SSH is usually used to
    connect to the controlled machine.</p><p>The network administrators usually prefer using some form
    of a RESTful API to control the servers, rather than using unix
    domain sockets directly. Therefore, as of Kea 1.2.0 release,
    Kea includes a new component called Control Agent (or CA) which
    exposes a RESTful API to the controlling clients and can forward
    commands to the respective Kea services over the unix domain
    sockets. The CA configuration has been described in
    <a class="xref" href="#agent-configuration" title="7.2.Â Configuration">SectionÂ 7.2, âConfigurationâ</a>.</p><p>The HTTP requests received by the CA contain the control
    commands encapsulated within HTTP requests. Simply speaking,
    the CA is responsible for stripping the HTTP layer from the
    received commands and forwarding the commands in a JSON format
    over the unix domain sockets to respective services. Because the
    CA receives commands for all services it requires additional
    "forwarding" information to be included in the client's messages.
    This "forwarding" information is carried within the
    <span class="command"><strong>service</strong></span> parameter of the received command.
    If the <span class="command"><strong>service</strong></span> parameter is not included or if
    the parameter is a blank list the CA will assume that the control
    command is targetted at the CA itself and will try to handle
    it on its own.
    </p><p>Control connections over both HTTP and unix domain sockets are
    guarded with timeouts. The default timeout value is set to 10s
    and is not configurable. The timeout configuration will be
    implemented in the future.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Kea 1.2.0 release and earlier had a limitation of 64kB
      on the maximum size of a command and a response sent over the unix

      release.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ctrl-channel-syntax"></a>16.1.Â Data Syntax</h2></div></div></div><p>Communication over the control channel is conducted using JSON
    structures. If configured, Kea will open a socket and listen
    for incoming connections. A process connecting to this socket
    is expected to send JSON commands structured as follows:

</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "command": "foo",
    "service": [ "dhcp4" ]
    "arguments": {
        "param1": "value1",
        "param2": "value2",
        ...
    }
}
</pre><p>

    The same command sent over the RESTful interface to the CA will have
    the following structure.

</p><pre class="screen">
    POST / HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Content-Type: application/json\r\n
    Content-Length: 147\r\n\r\n
    {
        "command": "foo",
        "service": [ "dhcp4" ]
        "arguments": {
            "param1": "value1",
            "param2": "value2",
            ...
        }
    }
</pre><p>

    <span class="command"><strong>command</strong></span> is the name of command to execute and
    is mandatory. <span class="command"><strong>arguments</strong></span> is a map of parameters
    required to carry out the given command.  The exact content and
    format of the map is command specific.</p><p>
      <span class="command"><strong>service</strong></span> is a list of the servers at which the control
      command is targetted. In the example above, the control command is
      targetted at the DHCPv4 server. In most cases, the CA will simply forward this
      command to the DHCPv4 server for processing via unix domain socket.
      Sometimes, the command including a service value may also be processed by the
      CA, if the CA is running a hooks library which handles such command for the
      given server. As an example, the hooks library attached to the CA
      may perform some operations on the database (like adding host reservations,
      modifying leases etc.). An advantage of performing DHCPv4 specific
      administrative operations in the CA rather than forwarding it to
      the DHCPv4 server is the ability to perform these operations without
      disrupting the DHCPv4 service (DHCPv4 server doesn't have to stop
      processing DHCP messages to apply changes to the database). Nevertheless,
      these situations are rather rare and, in most cases, when the
      <span class="command"><strong>service</strong></span> parameter contains a name of the service
      the commands are simply forwarded by the CA. The forwarded command
      includes the <span class="command"><strong>service</strong></span> parameter but this parameter
      is ignored by the receiving server. This parameter is only meaningful
      to the CA.
    </p><p>
      If the command received by the CA does not include a <span class="command"><strong>service</strong></span>
      parameter or this list is empty, the CA will simply process this message
      on its own. For example, the <span class="command"><strong>config-get</strong></span> command which
      doesn't include service parameter will return Control Agent's own
      configuration. The <span class="command"><strong>config-get</strong></span> including a service
      value "dhcp4" will be forwarded to the DHCPv4 server and will return
      DHCPv4 server's configuration and so on.
    </p><p>
      The following list contains a mapping of the values carried within the
      <span class="command"><strong>service</strong></span> parameter to the servers to which the commands
      are forwarded:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>dhcp4</strong></span> - the command is forwarded to the
          <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp4</strong></span> server,</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>dhcp6</strong></span> - the command is forwarded to the
          <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp6</strong></span> server,</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>d2</strong></span> - the command is forwarded to the
          <span class="command"><strong>kea-d2</strong></span> server.</li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>The server processing the incoming command will send a response of
    the form:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "result": 0|1|2|3,
    "text": "textual description",
    "arguments": {
        "argument1": "value1",
        "argument2": "value2",
        ...
    }
}
</pre><p>
    <span class="command"><strong>result</strong></span> indicates the outcome of the command. A value of 0
    means success while any non-zero value designates an error or at least a
    failure to complete the requested action. Currently 1 is used as a generic
    error, 2 means that a command is not supported and 3 means that the
    requested operation was completed, but the requested object was not
    found. Additional error codes may be added in the future. For example a well
    formed command that requests a subnet that exists in server's configuration
    would return result 0. If the server encounters an error condition, it would
    return 1. If the command was asking for IPv6 subnet, but was sent to DHCPv4
    server, it would return 2. If the query was asking for a subnet-id and there
    is no subnet with such id, the result would be set to 3.</p><p>
    The <span class="command"><strong>text</strong></span> field typically appears when result is non-zero
    and contains a description of the error encountered, but it often also appears
    for successful outcomes. The exact text is command specific, but in general
    uses plain English to describe the outcome of the command.
    <span class="command"><strong>arguments</strong></span> is a map of additional data values
    returned by the server which is specific to the command issued. The map is
    may be present, but that depends on specific command.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        When sending commands via Control Agent, it is possible to specify
        multiple services at which the command is targetted. CA will forward this
        command to each service individually. Thus, the CA response to the
        controlling client will contain an array of individual responses.

    which can be used to control the servers. These applications are, however, in the
    early stages of development and as of Kea 1.2.0 release have certain limitations.
    The easiest way to start interacting with the control API is to use common Unix/Linux tools
    such as <span class="command"><strong>socat</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>curl</strong></span>.</p><p>In order to control the given Kea service via unix domain socket, use
    <span class="command"><strong>socat</strong></span> as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ socat UNIX:/path/to/the/kea/socket -
</pre><p>
where <span class="command"><strong>/path/to/the/kea/socket</strong></span> is the path specified in the
<span class="command"><strong>Dhcp4/control-socket/socket-name</strong></span> parameter in the Kea
configuration file. Text passed to <span class="command"><strong>socat</strong></span>
will be sent to Kea and the responses received from Kea printed to standard
    output. This approach communicates with the specific server directly and
    bypasses Control Agent.</p><p>It is also easy to open UNIX socket programmatically. An example of
    such a simplistic client written in C is available in the Kea Developer's
    Guide, chapter Control Channel Overview, section Using Control Channel.</p><p>In order to use Kea's RESTful API with <span class="command"><strong>curl</strong></span> you may
    use the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "command": "config-get", "service": [ "dhcp4" ] }' http://ca.example.org:8000/
</pre><p>

    This assumes that the Control Agent is running on host
    <code class="filename">ca.example.org</code> and runs RESTful service on port 8000.

    If the new configuration proves to be invalid the server will retain
    its current configuration.  Please note that the new configuration is
    retained in memory only.  If the server is restarted or a configuration
    reload is triggered via a signal, the server will use the configuration
    stored in its configuration file.

        The server's response will contain a numeric code, "result" (0 for success,
    non-zero on failure), and  a string, "text", describing the outcome:
</p><pre class="screen">

      During its operation Kea may produce many messages. They differ in
      severity (some are more important than others) and source (some are
      produced by specific components, e.g. hooks). It is useful to understand
      which log messages are needed and which are not, and configure your
      logging appropriately. For example, debug level messages can be safely
      ignored in a typical deployment. They are, however, very useful when
      debugging a problem.
    </p><p>
      The logging system in Kea is configured through the
      Logging section in your configuration
      file. All daemons (e.g. DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers) will use the
      configuration in the Logging section to see
      what should be logged and to where. This allows for sharing identical
      logging configuration between daemons.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp59402512"></a>18.1.1.Â Loggers</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Within Kea, a message is logged through an entity called a
        "logger". Different components log messages through different
        loggers, and each logger can be configured independently of
        one another. Some components, in particular the DHCP server
        processes, may use multiple loggers to log messages pertaining
        to different logical functions of the component. For example,
        the DHCPv4 server uses one logger for messages
        pertaining to packet reception and transmission, another
        logger for messages related to lease allocation and so on.
        Some of the libraries used by the Kea servers, e.g. libdhcpsrv,
        use their own loggers.
      </p><p>
        Users implementing hooks libraries (code attached to the server at
        runtime) are responsible for creating the loggers used by those
        libraries. Such loggers should have unique names, different
        from the logger names used by Kea. In this way the
        messages output by the hooks library can be distinguished from
        messages issued by the core Kea code. Unique names also allow
        the loggers to be configured independently of loggers used
        by Kea.  Whenever it makes sense, a hook library can use multiple
        loggers to log messages pertaining to different logical parts
        of the library.
      </p><p>
        In the Logging section of a configuration file you can specify the
        configuration for zero or more loggers (including loggers used by the
        proprietary hooks libraries). If there are no loggers specified, the
        code will use default values: these cause Kea to log messages of INFO
        severity or greater to standard output. There is also a small
        time window after Kea has been started, but has not yet read its
        configuration. Logging in this short period can be controlled
        using environment variables. For details, see <a class="xref" href="#logging-during-startup" title="18.1.3.Â Logging During Kea Startup">SectionÂ 18.1.3, âLogging During Kea Startupâ</a>.
      </p><p>
        The three main elements of a logger configuration are:
        <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> (the component that is generating the messages),
        the <span class="command"><strong>severity</strong></span> (what to log), and the
        <span class="command"><strong>output_commands</strong></span> (where to log).  There is also a
        <span class="command"><strong>debuglevel</strong></span> element, which is only relevant if
        debug-level logging has been selected.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp59409824"></a>18.1.1.1.Â name (string)</h4></div></div></div><p>
          Each logger in the system has a name, the name being that of the
          component binary file using it to log messages. For instance, if you
          want to configure logging for the DHCPv4 server, you add an entry
          for a logger named <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4</span>â</span>. This configuration will
          then be used by the loggers in the DHCPv4 server, and all the
          libraries used by it (unless a library defines its own logger and
          there is specific logger configuration that applies to that logger).
        </p><p>
          When tracking down an issue with the server's operation, use of
          DEBUG logging is required to obtain the verbose output needed for
          problems diagnosis.  However, the high verbosity is likely to
          overwhelm the logging system in cases when the server
          is processing high volume traffic. To mitigate this problem, use
          can be made of the fact that Kea uses multiple loggers for different
          functional parts of the server and that each of these can be configured independently.
          If the user is reasonably confident that a problem originates
          in a specific function of the server, or that the problem is related
          to the specific type of operation, they may enable high verbosity
          only for the relevant logger, so limiting the debug messages
          to the required minimum.
        </p><p>
          The loggers are associated with a particular library or binary
          of Kea. However, each library or binary may (and usually does)
          include multiple loggers. For example, the DHCPv4 server binary
          contains separate loggers for: packet parsing, for dropped packets,
          for callouts etc.
        </p><p>
          The loggers form a hierarchy.  For each program in Kea, there is
          a "root" logger, named after the program (e.g. the root logger for
          kea-dhcp (the DHCPv4 server) is named kea-dhcp4.  All other loggers
          are children of this logger, and are named accordingly, e.g. the
          the allocation engine in the DHCPv4 server logs messages using
          a logger called kea-dhcp4.alloc-engine.
        </p><p>
          This relationship is important as each child logger derives its
          default configuration from its parent root logger.
          In the typical case, the root logger configuration
          is the only logging configuration specified in the configuration
          file and so applies to all loggers. If an entry is made for
          a given logger, any attributes specified override those of
          the root logger, whereas any not specified are inherited from it.
        </p><p>
          To illustrate this, suppose you are using the DHCPv4 server
          with the root logger <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4</span>â</span> logging at the
          INFO level. In order to enable DEBUG verbosity for the DHCPv4
          packet drops, you must create configuration entry for the
          logger called <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4.bad-packets</span>â</span> and specify
          severity DEBUG for this logger. All other configuration
          parameters may be omitted for this logger if the logger should
          use the default values specified in the root logger's
          configuration.
        </p><p>
          If there are multiple logger specifications in the configuration
          that might match a particular logger, the specification with the
          more specific logger name takes precedence. For example, if there
          are entries for both <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4</span>â</span> and
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4.dhcpsrv</span>â</span>, the DHCPv4 server â and all
          libraries it uses that are not dhcpsrv â will log messages
          according to the configuration in the first entry
          (<span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4</span>â</span>).

          Note that user-defined hook libraries should not use any of those
          loggers but should define new loggers with names that correspond to
          the libraries using them. Suppose that the user created the library
          called <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">libpacket-capture</span>â</span> to dump packets received and
          transmitted by the server to the file. The appropriate name for the
          logger could be <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp4.packet-capture</strong></span>. (Note
          that the hook library implementor only specifies the second part of
          this name, i.e. <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">packet-capture</span>â</span>. The first part is a
          root logger name and is prepended by the Kea logging system.) It is
          also important to note that since this new logger is a child of a root
          logger, it inherits the configuration from the root logger, something
          that can be overridden by an entry in the configuration file.
        </p><p>
          The list of loggers above excludes any loggers implemented in hooks
          libraries. Please consult the documentation for the libraries for the
          names of the loggers they define.
        </p><p>
          Additional loggers may be defined in future versions of Kea. The
          easiest way to find out the logger name is to configure all logging to
          go to a single destination and look for specific logger names. See
          <a class="xref" href="#logging-message-format" title="18.1.2.Â Logging Message Format">SectionÂ 18.1.2, âLogging Message Formatâ</a> for details.

          This specifies the category of messages logged.  Each message is
          logged with an associated severity which may be one of the following
          (in descending order of severity):
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

          When the severity of a logger is set to one of these values, it will
          only log messages of that severity and above (e.g. setting the logging
          severity to INFO will log INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages).  The
          severity may also be set to NONE, in which case all messages from that
          logger are inhibited.

            will have no effect, i.e. the servers will use logging severity of
            DEBUG regardless of the logging settings specified in the
            configuration file. If you need to control severity via
            configuration file, please make sure that the

            in bytes that a log file may reach.  When the maximum size is

            a ".1" is appended to the name â if a ".1" file exists, it
            is renamed ".2", etc. This is referred to as rotation.
          </p><p>
            The default value is 10240000 (10MB).  The smallest value that may
            be specified without disabling rotation is 204800. Any value less than

              Due to a limitation of the underlying logging library (log4cplus),
              rolling over the log files (from ".1" to ".2", etc) may show odd
              results: There can be multiple small files at the timing of roll
              over.  This can happen when multiple processes try to roll over
              the files simultaneously.  Version 1.1.0 of log4cplus solved this
              problem, so if this version or later of log4cplus is used to
              build Kea, it should not happen.  Even for older versions it is
              normally expected to happen rarely unless the log messages are
              produced very frequently by multiple different processes.

            reached, the oldest file, "log-name.maxver", will be discarded
            each time the log rotates. In other words, at most there will be
            the active log file plus maxver rotated files.  The minimum and
            default value is 1.

        The logging configuration is specified in the configuration file.
        However, when Kea starts, the file is not read until some way into the
        initialization process.  Prior to that, the logging settings are set to
        default values, although it is possible to modify some aspects of the
        settings by means of environment variables. Note that in the absence of
        any logging configuration in the configuration file, the settings of
        (possibly modified) default configuration will persist while the program
        is running.
      </p><p>
        The following environment variables can be used to control the behavior
        of logging during startup:
      </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">KEA_LOCKFILE_DIR</span></dt><dd><p>
              Specifies a directory where the logging system should create its

              <em class="replaceable"><code>prefix</code></em>/var/run/kea, where
              <em class="replaceable"><code>prefix</code></em> defaults to /usr/local.  This
              variable must not end with a slash. There is one special value:
              "none", which instructs Kea to not create lock file at all. This
              may cause issues if several processes log to the same file.
            </p></dd><dt><span class="term">KEA_LOGGER_DESTINATION</span></dt><dd><p>

    provides a RESTful control interface over HTTP. That API is typically expected to be used by
    various IPAMs and similar management systems. Nevertheless, there may be cases when you want
    to send a command to the CA directly.  The Kea Shell provides a way to do this.  It is a simple
    command-line, scripting-friendly text client that is able connect to the CA, send it commands
    with parameters, retrieve the responses and display them.</p><p>As the primary purpose of the Kea Shell is as a tool in scripting environment,
    it is not interactive. However, with simple tricks it can be run manually.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="shell-usage"></a>19.2.Â Shell Usage</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="command"><strong>kea-shell</strong></span> is run as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
kea-shell [--host hostname] [--port number] [--path path] [--timeout seconds] [--service service-name] [command]
</pre><p>
    where:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <span class="command"><strong>--host <em class="replaceable"><code>hostname</code></em></strong></span> specifies the hostname
          of the CA. If not specified, "localhost" is used.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <span class="command"><strong>--port <em class="replaceable"><code>number</code></em></strong></span> specifies the TCP port
          on which the CA listens. If not specified, 8000 is used.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <span class="command"><strong>--path <em class="replaceable"><code>path</code></em></strong></span> specifies
          the path in the URL to connect to. If not specified,
          empty path is used. As CA listens at the empty path
          this parameter is useful only with a reverse proxy.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <span class="command"><strong>--timeout <em class="replaceable"><code>seconds</code></em></strong></span> specifies the
          timeout (in seconds) for the connection. If not given, 10 seconds is used.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <span class="command"><strong>--service <em class="replaceable"><code>service-name</code></em></strong></span> specifies the
          target of a command. If not given, CA will be used as target.  May be used more
          than once to specify multiple targets.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <span class="command"><strong>command</strong></span> specifies the command to be sent. If not specified,
          <span class="command"><strong>list-commands</strong></span> command is used.
        </li></ul></div><p>Other switches are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <span class="command"><strong>-h</strong></span> prints a help message.
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <span class="command"><strong>-v</strong></span> prints the software version.
        </li></ul></div><p>
      Once started, the shell reads parameters for the command from standard input, which are
      expected to be in JSON format. When all have been read, the shell establishes a connection
      with the CA using HTTP, sends the command and awaits a response. Once that is received,
      it is printed on standard output.
    </p><p>
      For a list of available commands, see <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel" title="ChapterÂ 16.Â Management API">ChapterÂ 16, <i>Management API</i></a>. Additional commands
      may be provided by hook libraries. If unsure which commands are supported, use the
      <span class="command"><strong>list-commands</strong></span> command. It will instruct the CA to return a list of
      all supported commands.
    </p><p>The following shows a simple example of usage:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ <strong class="userinput"><code>kea-shell --host 192.0.2.1 --port 8001 --service dhcp4 list-commands</code></strong>
^D
</pre><p>
    After the command line is entered, the program waits for command parameters to be entered.
    Since <span class="command"><strong>list-commands</strong></span> does not take any
    arguments, CTRL-D (represented in the above example by "^D") is pressed to indicate end
    of file (and so terminate the parameter input). The Shell will then contact
    the CA and print out the list of available commands returned for the service named <span class="command"><strong>dhcp4</strong></span>.
    </p><p>It is envisaged that Kea Shell will be most frequently used in scripts. The next example
    shows a simple scripted execution. It sends the command "config-write" to the CA
    (<span class="command"><strong> --service </strong></span> parameter hasn't been used), along
    with the parameters specified in param.json. The result will be stored in result.json.
</p><pre class="screen">
$ cat param.json
"filename": "my-config-file.json"
$ <strong class="userinput"><code>cat param.json | kea-shell --host 192.0.2.1 config-write &gt; result.json</code></strong>
</pre><p>
    </p><p>When a reverse proxy is used to de-multiplex requests to different
    servers the default empty path in the URL is not enough so the
    <span class="command"><strong> --path </strong></span> parameter should be used. For instance
    if requests to the "/kea" path are forwarded to the CA this can be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ <strong class="userinput"><code>kea-shell --host 192.0.2.1 --port 8001 --path kea ...</code></strong>
</pre><p>
    </p><p>Kea Shell requires Python to to be installed on the system. It was tested with
    Python 2.7 and various versions
    of Python 3, up to 3.5. Since not every Kea deployment uses this feature and there are
    deployments that do not have Python, the Kea Shell is not enabled by default. To use it,
    you must specify <span class="command"><strong>--enable-shell</strong></span> to when running "configure" during the
    installation of Kea.</p><p>The Kea Shell is intended to serve more as a demonstration of the RESTful interface
    capabilities (and, perhaps, an illustration for people interested in integrating their
    management evironments with Kea) than as a serious management client. Do not expect it
    to be significantly expanded in the future. It is, and will remain, a simple tool.</p></div></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="faq"></a>ChapterÂ 20.Â Frequently Asked Questions</h1></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="section"><a href="#faq-generic">20.1.

      for an extended answer.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="q2-generic"></a>20.1.2.Â Feature X is not supported yet. When/if will it be available?</h3></div></div></div><p>Kea is developed by a small team of engineers. Our resources are
      limited, so we need to prioritize requests. The complexity of a new
      feature (how difficult it is to implement a feature and how likely it
      would break something that already works), amount of work required and
      expected popularity (i.e., how many users would actually benefit from it)
      are three leading factors. We sometimes also have contractual obligations.
      </p><p> Simply stating that you'd like feature X is useful. We try to
      implement features that are actively requested first, but the reality
      is that we have more requests than we can handle, so some of them must
      be postponed, at least in the near future. So is your request likely to
      be rejected? Not at all. You can do many things to greatly improve the
      chances of your request being fulfilled. First, it helps to explain why you
      need a feature. If your explanation is reasonable and there are likely
      other users that would benefit from it, the chances for Kea developers
      to put this task on a roadmap is better. Saying that you are willing
      to participate in tests (e.g., test engineering drops when they become
      available) is also helpful.</p><p>Another thing you can do to greatly improve the chances of a feature
      to appear is to actually develop it on your own and submit a patch.
      That's an avenue that people often forget about. Kea is open source
      software and we do accept patches. There are certain requirements, like
      code quality, comments, unit-tests, documentation, etc., but we have
      accepted a significant number of patches in the past, so it's doable.
      Accepted contributions range from minor documentation corrections to
      significant new features, like support for a new database type. Before
      considering writing and submitting a patch, make sure you read
      the Contributor's Guide in the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://git.kea.isc.org/~tester/kea/doxygen/" target="_top">Kea Developer's Guide</a>.
      </p><p>Kea is developed by ISC, which is a non-profit organization.
      You may consider signing a development contract with us. In the past
      we did implement certain features due to contractual obligations.
      With additional funds we are able to put extra engineering efforts
      into Kea development. We can reshuffle our schedule or add extra
      hands to the team if needed. Please keep in mind that Kea is
      open source software and its principle goal is to provide a good DHCP
      solution that can be used by everyone. In other words, we may
      refuse a contract that would tie the solution to specific proprietary
      technology or make it unusable for other users. Also, we strive to
      make Kea a reference implementation, so if your proposal significantly
      violates a RFC, we may have a problem with that. Nevertheless, please
      talk to us and we may be able to find a solution.</p><p>Finally, Kea has a <a class="ulink" href="http://kea.isc.org/roadmap" target="_top">public
      roadmap</a>, with releases happening several times each year. We tend
      to not modify plans for the current milestone, unless there are very good
      reasons to do so. Therefore "I'd like a feature X in 6 months" is much
      better received than "I'd like a feature X now".</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="faq-dhcp4"></a>20.2.Â Frequently Asked Questions about DHCPv4</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp59595232"></a>20.2.1.Â I set up a firewall, but the Kea server still receives the traffic. Why?</h3></div></div></div><p>Any DHCPv4 server must be able to receive from and send traffic to
      hosts that don't have an IPv4 address assigned yet. That is typically not
      possible with regular UDP sockets, therefore the Kea DHCPv4 server uses raw
      sockets by default. Raw sockets mean that the incoming packets are received
      as raw Ethernet frames, thus bypassing the whole kernel IP stack, including
      any firewalling rules your kernel may provide.</p><p>If you do not want the server to use raw sockets, it is possible to
      configure the Kea DHCPv4 server to use UDP sockets instead. See <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span>
      described in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-interface-configuration" title="8.2.4.Â Interface Configuration">SectionÂ 8.2.4, âInterface Configurationâ</a>. However,
      using UDP sockets has certain limitations. In particular, they may not allow
      for sending responses directly to clients without IPv4 addresses assigned.
      That's ok, if all your traffic is coming through relay agents.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="faq-dhcp6"></a>20.3.Â Frequently Asked Questions about DHCPv6</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp59600832"></a>20.3.1.Â Kea DHCPv6 doesn't seem to get incoming traffic. I checked with tcpdump (or other traffic
      capture software) that the incoming traffic is reaching the box. What's wrong?</h3></div></div></div><p>Please check whether your OS has any IPv6 filtering rules. Many
      operating systems are shipped with firewalls that discard incoming IPv6
      traffic by default. In particular, many Linux distributions do that. Please
      check the output of the following command:
  </p><pre class="screen">
# <strong class="userinput"><code>ip6tables -L -n</code></strong></pre><p>
      One common mistake in this area is to use <span class="command"><strong>iptables</strong></span> tool,
      which lists IPv4 firewall rules only.
