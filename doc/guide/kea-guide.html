      Kea is the next generation of DHCP software developed by ISC.
      It supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 protocols along with their
      extensions, e.g. prefix delegation and dynamic updates to DNS.
    </p><p>
      Kea was initially developed as a part of the BIND 10 framework.
      In early 2014, ISC made the decision to discontinue active
      development of BIND 10 and continue development of Kea as
      standalone DHCP software.
    </p><p>
      This guide covers Kea version 1.1.0.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp51327552"></a>1.1.Â Supported Platforms</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Kea is officially supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
	    CentOS, Fedora and FreeBSD systems. It is also likely to work on many
	    other platforms: Kea 1.1.0 builds have been tested on (in no
        particular order) Red Hat Enteprise Linux 6.4, Debian GNU/Linux 7,
        Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora Linux 19,
        Fedora 20, Fedora 22, CentOS Linux 7, NetBSD 6, FreeBSD 10.3,
        OpenBSD 5.7, OpenBSD 6.0, OS X 10.10, OS X 10.11.
      </p><p>There are currently no plans to port Kea to Windows platforms.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="required-software"></a>1.2.Â Required Software at Run-time</h2></div></div></div><p>
        Running Kea uses various extra software which may
        not be provided in the default installation of some operating systems,
        nor in the standard package collections. You may
        need to install this required software separately.

        Kea supports two cryptographic libraries: Botan and OpenSSL. Only one of

        requires the Botan cryptographic library for C++ (<a class="ulink" href="http://botan.randombit.net/" target="_top">http://botan.randombit.net/</a>), version 1.8, 1.9 or 1.10. If
        OpenSSL is used, (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.openssl.org/" target="_top">http://www.openssl.org/</a>), then Kea
        requires the OpenSSL C++ library version 1.0.*. Support for later

              For instructions concerning the installation and configuration
              of database backends for Kea, see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp-install-configure" title="3.6.Â DHCP Database Installation and Configuration">SectionÂ 3.6, âDHCP Database Installation and Configurationâ</a>.
              For information concerning the configuration backends, see
              <a class="xref" href="#dhcp-config-backend" title="3.5.Â Selecting the Configuration Backend">SectionÂ 3.5, âSelecting the Configuration Backendâ</a>.
            </p></div><p>
        </p><p>
          For example, the following command configures Kea to find the
          Boost headers in /usr/pkg/include, specifies that PostgreSQL
          support should be enabled, and sets the installation location
          to /opt/kea:

          </p><pre class="screen">$ <strong class="userinput"><code>./configure \
      --with-boost-include=/usr/pkg/include \
      --with-dhcp-pgsql=/usr/local/bin/pg_config \
      --prefix=/opt/kea</code></strong></pre><p>
        </p><p>
          If you have some problems with building Kea using the header-only
          Boost code or you'd like to use the Boost system library
          (assumed for the sake of this example to be located in /usr/pkg/lib):

          </p><pre class="screen">$ <strong class="userinput"><code>./configure \
      --with-boost-libs=-lboost_system \
      --with-boost-lib-dir=/usr/pkg/lib</code></strong></pre><p>
        </p><p>
          If <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> fails, it may be due to missing or old
          dependencies.
        </p><p>
          If <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> succeeds, it displays a report
          with the parameters used to build the code. This report is saved into
          the file <code class="filename">config.report</code> and is also embedded into
          the executable binaries, e.g., <strong class="userinput"><code>kea-dhcp4</code></strong>.

          After the configure step is complete, build the executables
          from the C++ code and prepare the Python scripts by running the command:
          </p><pre class="screen">$ <strong class="userinput"><code>make</code></strong></pre><p>

          </p><pre class="screen">$ <strong class="userinput"><code>make install</code></strong></pre><p>
        </p><p>
          Do not use any form of parallel or job server options
          (such as GNU make's <span class="command"><strong>-j</strong></span> option) when

        Kea stores its leases in a lease database.  The software has been
        written in a way that makes it possible to choose which database product
        should be used to store the lease information.  At present, Kea supports
        four database backends: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra and Memfile. To
        limit external dependencies, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Cassandra support are
        disabled by default and only Memfile is available. Support for the
        optional external database backend must be explicitly included when Kea
        is built.  This section covers the building of Kea with one of the
        optional backends and the creation of the lease database.

          When unit tests are built with Kea (the --with-gtest configuration option is specified),
          the databases must be manually pre-configured for the unit tests to run.

      Kea supports storing leases and host reservations (i.e. static
      assignments of addresses, prefixes and options) in one of
      the several supported databases. As future versions of Kea
      are released, the structure of those databases will change.
      For example, Kea currently only stores lease information
      and host reservations. Future versions of Kea will store
      additional data such as subnet definitions: the database
      structure will need to be updated to accomdate the extra
      information.
    </p><p>
      A given version of Kea expects a particular structure in
      the database and checks for this by examining the version of
      database it is using.  Separate version numbers are maintained for
      backend databases, independent of the version of Kea itself. It
      is possible that the backend database version will stay the same
      through several Kea revisions: similarly, it is possible that the
      version of backend database may go up several revisions during a
      Kea upgrade.  Versions for each database are independent, so an
      increment in the MySQL database version does not imply an increment
      in that of PostgreSQL.
    </p><p>
      Backend versions are specified in
      a <em class="replaceable"><code>major.minor</code></em> format. The minor
      number is increased when there are backward compatible changes
      introduced.  For example, the addition of a new index. It is
      desirable, but not mandatory to apply such a change; you
      can run on older database version if you want to. (Although, in
      the example given, running without the new index may be at the
      expense of a performance penalty.) On the other hand, the major
      number is increased when an incompatible change is introduced,
      for example an extra column is added to a table. If you try to
      run Kea software on a database that is too old (as signified by
      mismatched backend major version number), Kea will refuse to run:
      administrative action will be required to upgrade the database.

      <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin</strong></span> tool. It is able to initialize
      a new database, check its version number, perform a
      database upgrade, and dump lease data to a text file.

        There are no special steps required to upgrade memfile lease files
        from an earlier version of Kea to a new version of Kea.

        During startup the servers will check the schema version of the lease
        files against their own.  If there is a mismatch, the servers will
        automatically launch the LFC process to convert the files to the
        server's schema version.  While this mechanism is primarily meant to
        ease the process of upgrading to newer versions of Kea, it can also
        be used for downgrading should the need arise.  When upgrading, any
        values not present in the original lease files will be assigned
        appropriate default values.  When downgrading, any data present in
        the files but not in the server's schema will be dropped.

        If you wish to convert the files manually, prior to starting the
        servers you may do so by running the LFC process yourself.
        See <a class="xref" href="#kea-lfc" title="ChapterÂ 11.Â The LFC process">ChapterÂ 11, <i>The LFC process</i></a> for more information.

          To create the database:

              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                At this point, you may elect to create the database

          Sometimes a new Kea version may use newer database schema, so
          there will be a need to upgrade the existing database. This can
          be done using the <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin lease-upgrade</strong></span>
          command.
        </p><p>
          To check the current version of the database, use the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">

          about versioning.)  If the version does not match the minimum
          required for the new version of Kea (as described in the
          release notes), the database needs to be upgraded.
        </p><p>
          Before upgrading, please make sure that the database is
          backed up.  The upgrade process does not discard any data but,
          depending on the nature of the changes, it may be impossible
          to subsequently downgrade to an earlier version.  To perform
          an upgrade, issue the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">

        A PostgreSQL database must be set up if you want Kea to store
        lease and other information in PostgreSQL. This step can be
        safely ignored if you are using other database backends.

          The first task is to create both the lease database and the
          user under which the servers will access it. A number of steps
          are required:

              </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                At this point you are ready to create the database tables.
                This can be done using the <span class="command"><strong>kea-admin</strong></span> tool
                as explained in the next section (recommended), or manually.
                To create the tables manually enter the following command.
                Note that PostgreSQL will prompt you to enter the new user's
                password you specified in Step 3. When the command completes
                you will be returned to the shell prompt. You should see output
                similar to following:

              </p><p>
                If instead you encounter an error like:

                ... you will need to alter the PostgreSQL configuration.
                Kea uses password authentication when connecting to
                the database and must have the appropriate entries
                added to PostgreSQL's pg_hba.conf file.  This file is
                normally located in the primary data directory for your
                PostgreSQL server. The precise path may vary but the
                default location for PostgreSQL 9.3 on Centos 6.5 is:
                <code class="filename">/var/lib/pgsql/9.3/data/pg_hba.conf</code>.
              </p><p>
                Assuming Kea is running on the same host as PostgreSQL,
                adding lines similar to following should be sufficient to
                provide password-authenticated access to Kea's database:
</p><pre class="screen">

        The lease expiration time is stored in the SQL database for each lease
        as a timestamp value. Kea developers observed that MySQL database doesn't
        accept timestamps beyond 2147483647 seconds (maximum signed 32-bit number)
        from the beginning of the epoch. At the same time, some versions of PostgreSQL
        do accept greater values but the value is altered when it is read back.
        For this reason the lease database backends put the restriction for the
        maximum timestamp to be stored in the database, which is equal to the
        maximum signed 32-bit number. This effectively means that the current
        Kea version can't store the leases which expiration time is later than
        2147483647 seconds since the beginning of the epoch (around year 2038).
        This will be fixed when the database support for longer timestamps
        is available.

    available, that allowing configuration by means of a JSON file.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="json-backend"></a>5.1.Â JSON Configuration Backend</h2></div></div></div><p>JSON is the default configuration backend.
    It assumes that the servers are started from the command line
    (either directly or using a script, e.g. <code class="filename">keactrl</code>).
    The JSON backend uses certain signals to influence Kea. The
    configuration file is specified upon startup using the -c parameter.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="json-format"></a>5.1.1.Â JSON Syntax</h3></div></div></div><p>Configuration files for DHCPv4, DHCPv6 and DDNS modules are defined
      in an extended JSON format. Basic JSON is defined in <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627" target="_top">RFC 4627</a>.  Kea components
      use a slightly modified form of JSON in that they allow shell-style
      comments in the file: lines with the hash (#) character in the first column
      are comment lines and are ignored.</p><p>The configuration file consists of a single object (often colloquially
      called a map) started with a curly bracket. It comprises the "Dhcp4", "Dhcp6",
      "DhcpDdns" and/or "Logging" objects. It is possible to define additional
      elements, but they will be ignored. For example, it is possible to define
      Dhcp4, Dhcp6 and Logging elements in a single configuration file that can
      be used to start both the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 components. When starting,
      the DHCPv4 component will use Dhcp4 object to configure itself and the
      Logging object to configure logging parameters; it will ignore the Dhcp6
      object.</p><p>A very simple configuration for both DHCPv4 and

        If there is an array, a specific instance within that array is referenced by
        a number in square brackets (with numbering starting at zero). For example, in the above configuration the
        valid-lifetime in the Dhcp6 component can be referred to as
        Dhcp6/valid-lifetime and the pool in the first subnet defined in the DHCPv6

</pre><p>
      </p><p>Kea's servers create PID files upon startup. These files are used
      by keactrl to determine whether or not a given server is running.  If

      actually refer to processes unrelated to Kea.  This condition will cause
      keactrl to decide that the servers are running, when in fact they are

        As already mentioned, the reconfiguration of each Kea server is

        currently running. When a server receives the SIGHUP signal it
        re-reads its configuration file and, if the new configuration is

<strong class="userinput"><code>$ keactrl stop -s dhcp4,dhcp6</code></strong>
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        Similarly, the following
        will only start the <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp4</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp-ddns</strong></span> servers and not
        <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp6</strong></span>.
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>$ keactrl start -s dhcp4,dhcp_ddns</code></strong>
</pre><p>
      </p><p>
        Note that the behavior of the <span class="command"><strong>-s</strong></span> switch
        with the <span class="command"><strong>start</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>reload</strong></span> commands
        is different to its behavior with the <span class="command"><strong>stop</strong></span> command.
        On <span class="command"><strong>start</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>reload</strong></span>,
        <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> will check if the servers given as
        parameters to the <span class="command"><strong>-s</strong></span> switch are
        enabled in the <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> configuration file:
        if not, the server will be ignored.  For <span class="command"><strong>stop</strong></span> however,
        this check is not made: the command is applied to all listed servers,
        regardless of whether they have been enabled in the file.
      </p><p>

        It is recommended that the Kea DHCPv4 server be started and stopped
        using <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> (described in <a class="xref" href="#keactrl" title="ChapterÂ 6.Â Managing Kea with keactrl">ChapterÂ 6, <i>Managing Kea with keactrl</i></a>).
        However, it is also possible to run the server directly: it accepts
        the following command-line switches:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-c <em class="replaceable"><code>file</code></em></strong></span> -

            switch.</li><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-d</strong></span> - specifies whether the server
            logging should be switched to debug/verbose mode. In verbose mode,
            the logging severity and debuglevel specified in the configuration
            file are ignored and "debug" severity and the maximum debuglevel
            (99) are assumed. The flag is convenient, for temporarily

            <span class="command"><strong>-p <em class="replaceable"><code>port</code></em></strong></span> -
            specifies UDP port on which the server will listen. This is only
            useful during testing, as a DHCPv4 server listening on

            handle regular DHCPv4 queries.</li><li class="listitem">

        The <code class="filename">config.report</code> may also be accessed more

      </p><p>
        On start-up, the server will detect available network interfaces
        and will attempt to open UDP sockets on all interfaces
        mentioned in the configuration file.
        Since the DHCPv4 server opens privileged ports, it requires root
        access. Make sure you run this daemon as root.
      </p><p>
        During startup the server will attempt to create a PID file of the
        form: localstatedir]/[conf name].kea-dhcp6.pid where:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>localstatedir</strong></span>: The value as passed into the

            that this value may be overridden at run time by setting the environment
            variable KEA_PIDFILE_DIR.  This is intended primarily for testing purposes.)
            </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>conf name</strong></span>: The configuration file name
            used to start the server, minus all preceding path and file extension.
            For example, given a pathname of "/usr/local/etc/kea/myconf.txt", the
            portion used would be "myconf".
            </li></ul></div><p>
        If the file already exists and contains the PID of a live process,
        the server will issue a DHCP4_ALREADY_RUNNING log message and exit. It
        is possible, though unlikely, that the file is a remnant of a system crash
        and the process to which the PID belongs is unrelated to Kea.  In such a
        case it would be necessary to manually delete the PID file.
      </p><p>
        The server can be stopped using the <span class="command"><strong>kill</strong></span> command.
        When running in a console, the server can also be shut down by
        pressing ctrl-c. It detects the key combination and shuts
        down gracefully.

        This section explains how to configure the DHCPv4 server using the
        Kea configuration backend. (Kea configuration using any other
        backends is outside of scope of this document.) Before DHCPv4
        is started, its configuration file has to be created. The
        basic configuration is as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
# DHCPv4 configuration starts in this line
"Dhcp4": {

# First we set up global values
    "valid-lifetime": 4000,
    "renew-timer": 1000,
    "rebind-timer": 2000,

# Next we setup the interfaces to be used by the server.
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ "eth0" ]
    },

# And we specify the type of lease database
    "lease-database": {
        "type": "memfile",
        "persist": true,
        "name": "/var/kea/dhcp4.leases"
    },

# Finally, we list the subnets from which we will be leasing addresses.
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            "pools": [
                {
                     "pool": "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
# DHCPv4 configuration ends with the next line
}

} </pre><p>
</p><p>The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the parameters in
the above example together with
their format. Subsequent sections of this chapter go into much greater detail
for these and other parameters.</p><p>The lines starting with a hash (#) are comments and are ignored by
the server; they do not impact its
operation in any way.</p><p>The configuration starts in the first line with the initial
opening curly bracket (or brace). Each configuration consists of
one or more objects. In this specific example, we have only one
object, called Dhcp4. This is a simplified configuration, as usually
there will be additional objects, like <span class="command"><strong>Logging</strong></span> or
<span class="command"><strong>DhcpDns</strong></span>, but we omit them now for clarity. The Dhcp4
configuration starts with the <span class="command"><strong>"Dhcp4": {</strong></span> line
and ends with the corresponding closing brace (in the above example,
the brace after the last comment).  Everything defined between those
lines is considered to be the Dhcp4 configuration.</p><p>In the general case, the order in which those parameters appear does not
matter. There are two caveats here though. The first one is to remember that
the configuration file must be well formed JSON. That means that the parameters
for any given scope must be separated by a comma and there must not be a comma
after the last parameter. When reordering a configuration file, keep in mind that
moving a parameter to or from the last position in a given scope may also require
moving the comma. The second caveat is that it is uncommon â although
legal JSON â to
repeat the same parameter multiple times. If that happens, the last occurrence of a
given parameter in a given scope is used while all previous instances are
ignored. This is unlikely to cause any confusion as there are no real life
reasons to keep multiple copies of the same parameter in your configuration
file.</p><p>Moving onto the DHCPv4 configuration elements, the first few elements
define some global parameters. <span class="command"><strong>valid-lifetime</strong></span>
defines for how long the addresses (leases) given out by the
server are valid. If nothing changes, a client that got an address is allowed to
use it for 4000 seconds. (Note that integer numbers are specified as is,
without any quotes around them.) <span class="command"><strong>renew-timer</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>rebind-timer</strong></span> are values (also in seconds) that
define T1 and T2 timers that govern when the client will begin the renewal and
rebind procedures. Note that <span class="command"><strong>renew-timer</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>rebind-timer</strong></span> are optional. If they are not specified the
client will select values for T1 and T2 timers according to the
<a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131" target="_top">RFC 2131</a>.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>interfaces-config</strong></span> map specifies the server
configuration concerning the network interfaces, on which the server should
listen to the DHCP messages. The <span class="command"><strong>interfaces</strong></span> parameter
specifies a list of network interfaces on which the server should listen.
Lists are opened and closed with square brackets, with elements separated
by commas. Had we wanted to listen on two interfaces, the
<span class="command"><strong>interfaces-config</strong></span> would look like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
"interfaces-config": {
    "interfaces": [ "eth0", "eth1" ]
},
</pre><p>
</p><p>The next couple of lines define the lease database, the place where the server
stores its lease information. This particular example tells the server to use
<span class="command"><strong>memfile</strong></span>, which is the simplest (and fastest) database
backend. It uses an in-memory database and stores leases on disk in a CSV
file. This is a very simple configuration. Usually the lease database configuration
is more extensive and contains additional parameters.  Note that
<span class="command"><strong>lease-database</strong></span>
is an object and opens up a new scope, using an opening brace.
Its parameters (just one in this example - <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span>)
follow. Had there been more than one, they would be separated by commas. This
scope is closed with a closing brace. As more parameters for the Dhcp4 definition
follow, a trailing comma is present.</p><p>Finally, we need to define a list of IPv4 subnets. This is the
most important DHCPv4 configuration structure as the server uses that
information to process clients' requests. It defines all subnets from
which the server is expected to receive DHCP requests. The subnets are
specified with the <span class="command"><strong>subnet4</strong></span> parameter.  It is a list,
so it starts and ends with square brackets.  Each subnet definition in
the list has several attributes associated with it, so it is a structure
and is opened and closed with braces. At a minimum, a subnet definition
has to have at least two parameters: <span class="command"><strong>subnet</strong></span> (that
defines the whole subnet) and <span class="command"><strong>pools</strong></span> (which is a list of
dynamically allocated pools that are governed by the DHCP server).</p><p>The example contains a single subnet. Had more than one been defined,
additional elements
in the <span class="command"><strong>subnet4</strong></span> parameter would be specified and
separated by commas. For example, to define three subnets, the following
syntax would be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
"subnet4": [
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool":  "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200" } ],
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24"
    },
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.3.100 - 192.0.3.200" } ],
        "subnet": "192.0.3.0/24"
    },
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.4.1 - 192.0.4.254" } ],
        "subnet": "192.0.4.0/24"
    }
]
</pre><p>
Note that indentation is optional and is used for aesthetic purposes only.
In some cases in may be preferable to use more compact notation.
</p><p>After all the parameters have been specified, we have two contexts open:
global and Dhcp4, hence we need two closing curly brackets to close them.
In a real life configuration file there most likely would be additional
components defined such as Logging or DhcpDdns, so the closing brace would
be followed by a comma and another object definition.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp49823504"></a>7.2.2.Â Lease Storage</h3></div></div></div><p>All leases issued by the server are stored in the lease database.
  Currently there are four database backends available:  memfile (which is the
  default backend), MySQL, PostgreSQL and Cassandra.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp49824864"></a>7.2.2.1.Â Memfile - Basic Storage for Leases</h4></div></div></div><p>The server is able to store lease data in different repositories. Larger
  deployments may elect to store leases in a database. <a class="xref" href="#database-configuration4" title="7.2.2.2.Â Lease Database Configuration">SectionÂ 7.2.2.2, âLease Database Configurationâ</a> describes this option. In typical
  smaller deployments though, the server will store lease information in a CSV file rather
  than a database. As well as requiring less administration, an
  advantage of using a file for storage is that it
  eliminates a dependency on third-party database software.</p><p>The configuration of the file backend (Memfile) is controlled through
  the Dhcp4/lease-database parameters. The <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> parameter
  is mandatory and it specifies which storage for leases the server should use.
  The value of <strong class="userinput"><code>"memfile"</code></strong> indicates that the file should
  be used as the storage. The following list gives additional, optional,
  parameters that can be used to configure the Memfile backend.

  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>persist</strong></span>: controls whether the new leases and
      updates to existing leases are written to the file. It is strongly
      recommended that the value of this parameter is set to
      <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong> at all times, during the server's normal
      operation. Not writing leases to disk will mean that if a server is restarted
      (e.g. after a power failure), it will not know what addresses have been
      assigned.  As a result, it may hand out addresses to new clients that are
      already in use. The value of <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong> is mostly useful
      for performance testing purposes. The default value of the
      <span class="command"><strong>persist</strong></span> parameter is <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>,
      which enables writing lease updates
      to the lease file.
      </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>: specifies an absolute location of the lease
      file in which new leases and lease updates will be recorded. The default value
      for this parameter is <strong class="userinput"><code>"[kea-install-dir]/var/kea/kea-leases4.csv"
      </code></strong>.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span>: specifies the interval in seconds, at
      which the server will perform a lease file cleanup (LFC).  This
      removes redundant (historical) information from the lease file
      and effectively reduces the lease file size. The cleanup process is described
      in more detailed fashion further in this section. The default value of the
      <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> is <strong class="userinput"><code>0</code></strong>, which disables
      the LFC.</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>An example configuration of the Memfile backend is presented below:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "lease-database": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"type": "memfile"</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"persist": true</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "/tmp/kea-leases4.csv",</code></strong>
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"lfc-interval": 1800</code></strong>
    }
}
</pre><p>

    This configuration selects the <code class="filename">/tmp/kea-leases4.csv</code> as
    the storage for lease information and enables persistence (writing lease updates
    to this file). It also configures the backend perform the periodic cleanup
    of the lease files, executed every 30 minutes.
  </p><p>It is important to know how the lease file contents are organized
  to understand why the periodic lease file cleanup is needed. Every time
  the server updates a lease or creates a new lease for the client, the new
  lease information must be recorded in the lease file. For performance reasons,
  the server does not update the existing client's lease in the file, as it would
  potentially require rewriting the entire file. Instead, it simply appends the new lease
  information to the end of the file: the previous lease entries for the
  client are not removed. When the server loads leases from the lease file, e.g.
  at the server startup, it assumes that the latest lease entry for the client
  is the valid one. The previous entries are discarded. This means that the
  server can re-construct the accurate information about the leases even though
  there may be many lease entries for each client. However, storing many entries
  for each client results in bloated lease file and impairs the performance of
  the server's startup and reconfiguration as it needs to process a larger number
  of lease entries.
  </p><p>Lease file cleanup (LFC) removes all previous entries for each client and
  leaves only the latest ones. The interval at which the cleanup is performed
  is configurable, and it should be selected according to the frequency of lease
  renewals initiated by the clients. The more frequent the renewals, the smaller
  the value of <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> should be. Note however, that the
  LFC takes time and thus it is possible (although unlikely) that new cleanup
  is started while the previous cleanup instance is still running, if the
  <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> is too short. The server would recover from
  this by skipping the new cleanup when it detects that the previous cleanup
  is still in progress. But it implies that the actual cleanups will be
  triggered more rarely than configured. Moreover, triggering a new cleanup
  adds an overhead to the server which will not be able to respond to new
  requests for a short period of time when the new cleanup process is spawned.
  Therefore, it is recommended that the <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> value
  is selected in a way that would allow for the LFC to complete the cleanup before a
  new cleanup is triggered.
  </p><p>Lease file cleanup is performed by a separate process (in background) to avoid
  a performance impact on the server process. In order to avoid the conflicts
  between two processes both using the same lease files, the LFC process
  operates on the copy of the original lease file, rather than on the lease
  file used by the server to record lease updates. There are also other files
  being created as a side effect of the lease file cleanup. The detailed
  description of the LFC is located on the Kea wiki:

In some deployments the database user whose name is specified in the database backend
configuration may not have write privileges to the database. This is often
required by the policy within a given network to secure the data from being
unintentionally modified. In many cases administrators have inventory databases
deployed, which contain substantially more information about the hosts than
static reservations assigned to them. The inventory database can be used to create
a view of a Kea hosts database and such view is often read only.
</p><p>
Kea host database backends operate with an implicit configuration to both
read from and write to the database. If the database user does not have
write access to the host database, the backend will fail to start and the
server will refuse to start (or reconfigure). However, if access to a read
only host database is required for retrieving reservations for clients
and/or assign specific addresses and options, it is possible to explicitly
configure Kea to start in "read-only" mode. This is controlled by the
<span class="command"><strong>readonly</strong></span> boolean parameter as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { "hosts-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"readonly": true</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
Setting this parameter to <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong> would configure the
database backend to operate in "read-write" mode, which is also a default
configuration if the parameter is not specified.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The <span class="command"><strong>readonly</strong></span> parameter is currently only supported

  interfaces.  The simplest network interface configuration tells the server to
  listen on all available interfaces:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"*"</code></strong> ]
    }
    ...
},
  </pre><p>
  The asterisk plays the role of a wildcard and means "listen on all interfaces".
  However, it is usually a good idea to explicitly specify interface names:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
  </p><p>It is possible to use wildcard interface name (asterisk) concurrently
  with explicit interface names:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3", "*"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
It is anticipated that this form of usage will only be used when it is desired to
temporarily override a list of interface names and listen on all interfaces.
  </p><p>Some deployments of DHCP servers require that the servers listen
  on the interfaces with multiple IPv4 addresses configured. In these situations,
  the address to use can be selected by appending an IPv4 address to the interface
  name in the following manner:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1/10.0.0.1", "eth3/192.0.2.3"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
  </p><p>Should the server be required to listen on multiple IPv4 addresses assigned
  to the same interface, multiple addresses can be specified for an interface
  as in the example below:
  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1/10.0.0.1", "eth1/10.0.0.2"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
  </p><p>Alternatively, if the server should listen on all addresses for the particular
  interface, an interface name without any address should be specified.</p><p>Kea supports responding to directly connected clients which don't have
  an address configured. This requires that the server
  injects the hardware address of the destination into the data link layer
  of the packet being sent to the client. The DHCPv4 server utilizes the
  raw sockets to achieve this, and builds the entire IP/UDP stack for the
  outgoing packets. The down side of raw socket use, however, is that incoming
  and outgoing packets bypass the firewalls (e.g. iptables). It is also
  troublesome to handle traffic on multiple IPv4 addresses assigned to the
  same interface, as raw sockets are bound to the interface and advanced
  packet filtering techniques (e.g. using the BPF) have to be used to
  receive unicast traffic on the desired addresses assigned to the interface,
  rather than capturing whole traffic reaching the interface to which the raw
  socket is bound. Therefore, in the deployments where the server doesn't
  have to provision the directly connected clients and only receives the
  unicast packets from the relay agents, the
  DHCP server should be configured to utilize IP/UDP datagram sockets instead of raw sockets.
  The following configuration demonstrates how this can be achieved:

  </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1", "eth3"</code></strong> ],
        "dhcp-socket-type": "udp"
    },
    ...
}
  </pre><p>
  The <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span> specifies that the IP/UDP sockets will
  be opened on all interfaces on which the server listens, i.e. "eth1" and
  "eth3" in our case. If the <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span> is set to
  <strong class="userinput"><code>raw</code></strong>, it configures the server to use raw sockets
  instead. If the <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span> value is not specified, the
  default value <strong class="userinput"><code>raw</code></strong> is used.
  </p><p>Using UDP sockets automatically disables the reception of broadcast
  packets from directly connected clients. This effectively means that the
  UDP sockets can be used for relayed traffic only. When using the raw sockets,
  both the traffic from the directly connected clients and the relayed traffic
  will be handled. Caution should be taken when configuring the server to open
  multiple raw sockets on the interface with several IPv4 addresses assigned.
  If the directly connected client sends the message to the broadcast address
  all sockets on this link will receive this message and multiple responses
  will be sent to the client. Hence, the configuration with multiple IPv4
  addresses assigned to the interface should not be used when the directly
  connected clients are operating on that link. To use a single address on
  such interface, the "interface-name/address" notation should be used.
  </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Specifying the value <strong class="userinput"><code>raw</code></strong> as the socket type,
    doesn't guarantee that the raw sockets will be used! The use of raw sockets
    to handle the traffic from the directly connected clients is currently
    supported on Linux and BSD systems only. If the raw sockets are not
    supported on the particular OS, the server will issue a warning and
    fall back to use IP/UDP sockets.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcpinform-unicast-issues"></a>7.2.5.Â Issues with Unicast Responses to DHCPINFORM</h3></div></div></div><p>The use of UDP sockets has certain benefits in deployments
  where the server receives only relayed traffic; these benefits are
  mentioned in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-interface-configuration" title="7.2.4.Â Interface Configuration">SectionÂ 7.2.4, âInterface Configurationâ</a>. From
  the administrator's perspective it is often desirable to
  configure the system's firewall to filter out the unwanted traffic, and
  the use of UDP sockets facilitates this. However, the administrator must
  also be aware of the implications related to filtering certain types
  of traffic as it may impair the DHCP server's operation.
  </p><p>In this section we are focusing on the case when the server
  receives the DHCPINFORM message from the client via a relay. According
  to <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131" target="_top">RFC 2131</a>,
  the server should unicast the DHCPACK response to the address carried in
  the "ciaddr" field. When the UDP socket is in use, the DHCP server
  relies on the low level functions of an operating system to build the
  data link, IP and UDP layers of the outgoing message. Typically, the
  OS will first use ARP to obtain the client's link layer address to be
  inserted into the frame's header, if the address is not cached from
  a previous transaction that the client had with the server.
  When the ARP exchange is successful, the DHCP message can be unicast
  to the client, using the  obtained address.
  </p><p>Some system administrators block ARP messages in their network,
  which causes issues for the server when it responds to the
  DHCPINFORM messages, because the server is unable to send the
  DHCPACK if the preceding ARP communication fails. Since the OS is
  entirely responsible for the ARP communication and then sending
  the DHCP packet over the wire, the DHCP server has no means to
  determine that the ARP exchange failed and the DHCP response message
  was dropped. Thus, the server does not log any error messages when
  the outgoing DHCP response is dropped. At the same time, all hooks
  pertaining to the packet sending operation will be called, even
  though the message never reaches its destination.
  </p><p>Note that the issue described in this section is not observed
  when the raw sockets are in use, because, in this case, the DHCP server
  builds all the layers of the outgoing message on its own and does not
  use ARP. Instead, it inserts the value carried in the 'chaddr' field
  of the DHCPINFORM message into the link layer.
  </p><p>Server administrators willing to support DHCPINFORM
  messages via relays should not block ARP traffic in their
  networks or should use raw sockets instead of UDP sockets.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ipv4-subnet-id"></a>7.2.6.Â IPv4 Subnet Identifier</h3></div></div></div><p>
    The subnet identifier is a unique number associated with a particular subnet.
    In principle, it is used to associate clients' leases with their respective subnets.
    When a subnet identifier is not specified for a subnet being configured, it will
    be automatically assigned by the configuration mechanism. The identifiers
    are assigned from 1 and are monotonically increased for each subsequent
    subnet: 1, 2, 3 ....
  </p><p>
    If there are multiple subnets configured with auto-generated identifiers and
    one of them is removed, the subnet identifiers may be renumbered. For example:
    if there are four subnets and the third is removed the last subnet will be assigned
    the identifier that the third subnet had before removal. As a result, the leases
    stored in the lease database for subnet 3 are now associated with
    subnet 4, something that may have unexpected consequences. It is planned
    to implement a mechanism to preserve auto-generated subnet ids in a
    future version of Kea.  However, the only remedy for this issue
    at present is to
    manually specify a unique identifier for each subnet.
  </p><p>
        The following configuration will assign the specified subnet
        identifier to the newly configured subnet:

        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
        {

            <strong class="userinput"><code>"id": 1024</code></strong>,
            ...
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
    This identifier will not change for this subnet unless the "id" parameter is
    removed or set to 0. The value of 0 forces auto-generation of the subnet
    identifier.
  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp4-address-config"></a>7.2.7.Â Configuration of IPv4 Address Pools</h3></div></div></div><p>
    The main role of a DHCPv4 server is address assignment. For this, the server has to
    be configured with at least one subnet and one pool of dynamic addresses for it to manage.
    For example, assume that the server is connected to a network
    segment that uses the 192.0.2.0/24 prefix. The Administrator of that network
    has decided that addresses from range 192.0.2.10 to 192.0.2.20 are going to
    be managed by the Dhcp4 server. Such a configuration can be achieved in the
    following way:
    </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            "pools": [
                { "pool": "192.0.2.10 - 192.0.2.20" }
            ],
            ...
        }
    ]</code></strong>
}</pre><p>

    Note that <span class="command"><strong>subnet</strong></span> is defined as a simple string, but
    the <span class="command"><strong>pools</strong></span> parameter is actually a list of pools: for
    this reason, the pool definition is enclosed in square brackets, even
    though only one range of addresses is specified.</p><p>Each <span class="command"><strong>pool</strong></span> is a structure that contains the
    parameters that describe a single pool. Currently there is only one
    parameter, <span class="command"><strong>pool</strong></span>, which gives the range of addresses
    in the pool. Additional parameters will be added in future releases of
    Kea.</p><p>It is possible to define more than one pool in a subnet: continuing
    the previous example, further assume that 192.0.2.64/26 should be also be
    managed by the server. It could be written as 192.0.2.64 to
    192.0.2.127. Alternatively, it can be expressed more simply as
    192.0.2.64/26. Both formats are supported by Dhcp4 and can be mixed in the
    pool list.  For example, one could define the following pools:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"pools": [
                { "pool": "192.0.2.10-192.0.2.20" },
                { "pool": "192.0.2.64/26" }
            ]</code></strong>,
            ...
        }
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
    White space in pool definitions is ignored, so spaces before and after the hyphen are optional.
    They can be used to improve readability.
  </p><p>
    The number of pools is not limited, but for performance reasons it is recommended to
    use as few as possible.
  </p><p>
    The server may be configured to serve more than one subnet:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200" } ],
            ...
        },
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.3.0/24",
            "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.3.100 - 192.0.3.200" } ],
            ...
        },
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.4.0/24",
            "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.4.1 - 192.0.4.254" } ],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
  </p><p>
    When configuring a DHCPv4 server using prefix/length notation, please pay
    attention to the boundary values. When specifying that the server can use
    a given pool, it will also be able to allocate the first (typically network
    address) and the last (typically broadcast address) address from that pool.
    In the aforementioned example of pool 192.0.3.0/24, both 192.0.3.0 and
    192.0.3.255 addresses may be assigned as well. This may be invalid in some
    network configurations. If you want to avoid this, please use the "min-max" notation.

        option are commonly used options, e.g. "Domain Server", and options which
        require special behavior, e.g. "Client FQDN" is returned to the client
        if the client has included this option in its message to the server.

        It is possible to specify or override options on a per-subnet basis.  If
        clients connected to most of your subnets are expected to get the
        same values of a given option, you should use global options: you
        can then override specific values for a small number of subnets.
        On the other hand, if you use different values in each subnet,
        it does not make sense to specify global option values
        (Dhcp4/option-data), rather you should set only subnet-specific values
        (Dhcp4/subnet[X]/option-data[Y]).

        The "Name" and "Code"
        are the values that should be used as a name in the option-data
        structures. "Type" designates the format of the data: the meanings of
        the various types is given in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp-types" title="TableÂ 7.3.Â List of standard DHCP option types">TableÂ 7.3, âList of standard DHCP option typesâ</a>.
      </p><p>
        Some options are designated as arrays, which means that more than one
        value is allowed in such an option. For example the option time-servers
        allows the specification of more than one IPv4 address, so allowing
        clients to obtain the addresses of multiple NTP servers.
      </p><p>
        The <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-custom-options" title="7.2.9.Â Custom DHCPv4 options">SectionÂ 7.2.9, âCustom DHCPv4 optionsâ</a> describes the configuration
        syntax to create custom option definitions (formats). It is generally not
        allowed to create custom definitions for standard options, even if the
        definition being created matches the actual option format defined in the
        RFCs. There is an exception from this rule for standard options for which
        Kea currently does not provide a definition. In order to use such options,
        a server administrator must create a definition as described in
        <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-custom-options" title="7.2.9.Â Custom DHCPv4 options">SectionÂ 7.2.9, âCustom DHCPv4 optionsâ</a> in the 'dhcp4' option space. This
        definition should match the option format described in the relevant
        RFC but the configuration mechanism will allow any option format as it
        presently has no means to validate it.

      left blank: <span class="command"><strong>record-types</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span>.  The former specifies the comma separated
      list of option data fields if the option comprises a record of data
      fields. This should be non-empty if the <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> is set to
      "record". Otherwise it must be left blank. The latter parameter specifies
      the name of the option space being encapsulated by the particular
      option. If the particular option does not encapsulate any option space it
      should be left blank.  Note that the above set of comments define the
      format of the new option and do not set its values.
      </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>code</strong></span> and

      (i.e. ""). The default <span class="command"><strong>space</strong></span> is "dhcp4".
      </p><p>Once the new option format is defined, its value is set

      an IPv4 address, followed by an unsigned 16 bit integer, followed by
      a boolean value, followed by a text string. Such an option could
      be defined in the following way:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "bar",

            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }, ...
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> is set to "record" to indicate that the option contains
      multiple values of different types.  These types are given as a comma-separated
      list in the <span class="command"><strong>record-types</strong></span> field and should be ones from those listed in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp-types" title="TableÂ 7.3.Â List of standard DHCP option types">TableÂ 7.3, âList of standard DHCP option typesâ</a>.
      </p><p>
      The values of the option are set as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">

      Currently there are two option spaces defined for the DHCPv4 daemon:
      "dhcp4" (for the top level DHCPv4 options) and
      "vendor-encapsulated-options-space", which is empty by default but
      in which options can be defined. Such options will be carried in the
      Vendor Specific Information option (code 43). The following examples
      show how to define an option "foo" in that space that has a code 1,
      and comprises an
      IPv4 address, an unsigned 16 bit integer and a string. The "foo"
      option is conveyed in a Vendor Specific Information option.
      </p><p>
      The first step is to define the format of the option:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "foo",
            "code": 1,
            "space": "vendor-encapsulated-options-space",
            "type": "record",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "ipv4-address, uint16, string",
            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
     (Note that the option space is set to "vendor-encapsulated-options-space".)
     Once the option format is defined, the next step is to define actual values
     for that option:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "foo",
            "space": "vendor-encapsulated-options-space",
            "code": 1,
            "csv-format": true,
            "data": "192.0.2.3, 123, Hello World"</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
    We also include the Vendor Specific Information option, the option
    that conveys our sub-option "foo". This is required, else the option
    will not be included in messages sent to the client.
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "vendor-encapsulated-options"</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
    Alternatively, the option can be specified using its code.

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"code": 43</code></strong>

    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp4-option-spaces"></a>7.2.11.Â Nested DHCPv4 Options (Custom Option Spaces)</h3></div></div></div><p>It is sometimes useful to define a completely new option
      space. This is the case when user creates new option in the
      standard option space ("dhcp4") and wants this option
      to convey sub-options. Since they are in a separate space,
      sub-option codes will have a separate numbering scheme and may
      overlap with the codes of standard options.
      </p><p>Note that creation of a new option space when defining
      sub-options for a standard option is not required, because it is
      created by default if the standard option is meant to convey any
      sub-options (see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-vendor-opts" title="7.2.10.Â DHCPv4 Vendor Specific Options">SectionÂ 7.2.10, âDHCPv4 Vendor Specific Optionsâ</a>).
      </p><p>
      Assume that we want to have a DHCPv4 option called "container" with
      code 222 that conveys two sub-options with codes 1 and 2.
      First we need to define the new sub-options:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "subopt1",
            "code": 1,
            "space": "isc",
            "type": "ipv4-address",
            "record-types": "",
            "array": false,
            "encapsulate": ""
        },
        {
            "name": "subopt2",
            "code": 2,
            "space": "isc",
            "type": "string",
            "record-types": "",
            "array": false,
            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
    Note that we have defined the options to belong to a new option space
    (in this case, "isc").
    </p><p>
    The next step is to define a regular DHCPv4 option with our desired
    code and specify that it should include options from the new option space:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        ...,
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "container",
            "code": 222,
            "space": "dhcp4",
            "type": "empty",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "",
            "encapsulate": "isc"</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
    The name of the option space in which the sub-options are defined
    is set in the <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span> field. The <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> field is set to "empty"
    to indicate that this option does not carry any data other than
    sub-options.
    </p><p>
    Finally, we can set values for the new options:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "subopt1",
            "code": 1,
            "space": "isc",
            "data": "192.0.2.3"</code></strong>
        },
        }
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "subopt2",
            "code": 2,
            "space": "isc",
            "data": "Hello world"</code></strong>
        },
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "container",
            "code": 222,
            "space": "dhcp4"</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
    </p><p>Note that it is possible to create an option which carries some data
    in addition to the sub-options defined in the encapsulated option space.  For example,
    if the "container" option from the previous example was required to carry an uint16
    value as well as the sub-options, the <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> value would have to be set to "uint16" in
    the option definition. (Such an option would then have the following
    data structure: DHCP header, uint16 value, sub-options.) The value specified
    with the <span class="command"><strong>data</strong></span> parameter â which should be a valid integer enclosed in quotes,
    e.g. "123" â would then be assigned to the uint16 field in the "container" option.

      an option configuration and the default values may be used. However, it is
      important to understand the implications of not specifying some of them
      as it may result in configuration errors. The list below explains
      the behavior of the server when a particular parameter is not explicitly
      specified:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> - the server requires an option name or
          option code to identify an option. If this parameter is unspecified, the
          option code must be specified.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>code</strong></span> - the server requires an option name or
          option code to identify an option. This parameter may be left unspecified if
          the <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> parameter is specified. However, this also
          requires that the particular option has its definition (it is either a
          standard option or an administrator created a definition for the option
          using an 'option-def' structure), as the option definition associates an
          option with a particular name. It is possible to configure an option
          for which there is no definition (unspecified option format).
          Configuration of such options requires the use of option code.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>space</strong></span> - if the option space is unspecified it
          will default to 'dhcp4' which is an option space holding DHCPv4 standard
          options.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>data</strong></span> - if the option data is unspecified it
          defaults to an empty value. The empty value is mostly used for the
          options which have no payload (boolean options), but it is legal to specify
          empty values for some options which carry variable length data and which
          the specification allows for the length of 0. For such options, the data parameter
          may be omitted in the configuration.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>csv-format</strong></span> - if this value is not specified
          and the definition for the particular option exists, the server will assume
          that the option data is specified as a list of comma separated values to be
          assigned to individual fields of the DHCP option. If the definition
          does not exist for this option, the server will assume that the data
          parameter contains the option payload in the binary format (represented
          as a string of hexadecimal digits). Note that not specifying this
          parameter doesn't imply that it defaults to a fixed value, but
          the configuration data interpretation also depends on the presence
          of the option definition. An administrator must be aware if the
          definition for the particular option exists when this parameter
          is not specified. It is generally recommended to not specify this
          parameter only for the options for which the definition exists, e.g.
          standard options. Setting <span class="command"><strong>csv-format</strong></span> to an explicit
          value will cause the server to strictly check the format of the option
          data specified.

      contacts the server to obtain other configuration parameters, e.g. addresses of DNS servers.
      In order to obtain the stateless configuration parameters the client sends the
      DHCPINFORM message to the server with the "ciaddr" set to the address that the
      client is currently using. The server unicasts the DHCPACK message to the
      client that includes the stateless configuration ("yiaddr" not set).

      </p><p>This subnet specifies the single option which will be included in

      The DHCPv4 server includes support for client classification.  For a deeper
      discussion of the classification process see <a class="xref" href="#classify" title="ChapterÂ 12.Â Client Classification">ChapterÂ 12, <i>Client Classification</i></a>.
      </p><p>
      In certain cases it is useful to differentiate between different types of
      clients and treat them accordingly. It is envisaged that client
      classification will be used for changing the behavior of almost any part of
      the DHCP message processing, including the assignment of leases from different
      pools, the assignment of different options (or different values of the same
      options) etc. In the current release of the software however, there are
      only three mechanisms that take advantage of client classification:
      subnet selection, assignment of different options, and, for cable modems, there
      are specific options for use with the TFTP server address and the boot file field.
      </p><p>
      Kea can be instructed to limit access to given subnets based on class information.
      This is particularly useful for cases where two types of devices share the
      same link and are expected to be served from two different subnets. The
      primary use case for such a scenario is cable networks. Here, there are two
      classes of devices: the cable modem itself, which should be handed a lease
      from subnet A and all other devices behind the modem that should get a lease
      from subnet B. That segregation is essential to prevent overly curious
      users from playing with their cable modems. For details on how to set up
      class restrictions on subnets, see <a class="xref" href="#classification-subnets" title="12.6.Â Configuring Subnets With Class Information">SectionÂ 12.6, âConfiguring Subnets With Class Informationâ</a>.
      </p><p>
      The process of doing classification is conducted in three steps. The first step
      is to assess an incoming packet and assign it to zero or more classes.  The
      second step is to choose a subnet, possibly based on the class information.
      The third step is to assign options, again possibly based on the class
      information.
      </p><p>
      There are two methods of doing classification. The first is automatic and relies
      on examining the values in the vendor class options. Information from these
      options is extracted and a class name is constructed from it and added to
      the class list for the packet. The second allows you to specify an expression
      that is evaluated for each packet. If the result is true the packet is
      a member of the class.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        Care should be taken with client classification as it is easy for
        clients that do not meet class criteria to be denied any service altogether.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp56168400"></a>7.2.14.1.Â Setting Fixed Fields in Classification</h4></div></div></div><p>
          It is possible to specify that clients belonging to a particular class
          should receive packets with specific values in certain fixed fields.
          In particular, three fixed fields are supported:
          <span class="command"><strong>next-server</strong></span> (that conveys an IPv4 address, which is
          set in the siaddr field), <span class="command"><strong>server-hostname</strong></span> (that
          conveys a server hostname, can be up to 64 bytes long and will be sent
          in the sname field) and <span class="command"><strong>boot-file-name</strong></span> (that
          conveys the configuration file, can be up to 128 bytes long and will
          be sent using file field).
        </p><p>
          Obviously, there are many ways to assign clients to specific classes,
          but for the PXE clients the client architecture type option (code 93)
          seems to be particularly suited to
          make the distinction. The following example checks if the client
          identifies itself as PXE device with architecture EFI x86-64, and
          sets several fields if it does. See
          <a class="ulink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4578#section-2.1" target="_top">Section 2.1 of RFC 4578</a>)

        The server checks whether an incoming packet includes the vendor class identifier
        option (60). If it does, the content of that option is prepended with
        "VENDOR_CLASS_", it is interpreted as a class. For example,
        modern cable modems will send this option with value "docsis3.0"
        and as a result the packet will belong to class "VENDOR_CLASS_docsis3.0".

      As mentioned earlier, kea-dhcp4 can be configured to generate requests to the
      DHCP-DDNS server (referred to here as "D2" ) to update DNS entries.  These requests are known as
      NameChangeRequests or NCRs.  Each NCR contains the following information:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
      Whether it is a request to add (update) or remove DNS entries
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Whether the change requests forward DNS updates (A records), reverse
      DNS updates (PTR records), or both.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      The FQDN, lease address, and DHCID
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      The parameters for controlling the generation of NCRs for submission to D2
      are contained in the <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-ddns</strong></span> section of the kea-dhcp4 server
      configuration. The mandatory parameters for the DHCP DDNS configuration
      are <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span> which is unconditionally
      required, and <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> which has no
      default value and is required when <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span>
      is set to <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span>.

      The two (disabled and enabled) minimal DHCP DDNS configurations are:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"enable-updates": false</code></strong>

      In order for NCRs to reach the D2 server, kea-dhcp4 must be able
      to communicate with it.  kea-dhcp4 uses the following configuration
      parameters to control this communication:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span> - determines whether or not kea-dhcp4 will
      generate NCRs.  By default, this value is false hence DDNS updates are
      disabled.  To enable DDNS updates set this value to true:
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>server-ip</strong></span> - IP address on which D2 listens for requests. The default is
      the local loopback interface at address 127.0.0.1. You may specify
      either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>server-port</strong></span> - port on which D2 listens for requests.  The default value
      is 53001.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>sender-ip</strong></span> - IP address which kea-dhcp4 should use to send requests to D2.
      The default value is blank which instructs kea-dhcp4 to select a suitable
      address.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>sender-port</strong></span> - port which kea-dhcp4 should use to send requests to D2. The
      default value of 0 instructs kea-dhcp4 to select a suitable port.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>max-queue-size</strong></span> - maximum number of requests allowed to queue waiting to
      be sent to D2. This value guards against requests accumulating
      uncontrollably if they are being generated faster than they can be
      delivered.  If the number of requests queued for transmission reaches
      this value, DDNS updating will be turned off until the queue backlog has
      been sufficiently reduced.  The intention is to allow the kea-dhcp4 server to
      continue lease operations without running the risk that its memory usage
      grows without limit.  The default value is 1024.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>ncr-protocol</strong></span> - socket protocol use when sending requests to D2.  Currently
      only UDP is supported.  TCP may be available in an upcoming release.

      By default, kea-dhcp-ddns is assumed to be running on the same machine as kea-dhcp4, and
      all of the default values mentioned above should be sufficient.
      If, however, D2 has been configured to listen on a different address or
      port, these values must be altered accordingly. For example, if D2 has been
      configured to listen on 192.168.1.10 port 900, the following configuration
      would be required:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"server-ip": "192.168.1.10",

      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4702" target="_top">RFC 4702</a>.
      It is important to keep in mind that kea-dhcp4 provides the initial decision
      making of when and what to update and forwards that information to D2 in
      the form of NCRs. Carrying out the actual DNS updates and dealing with
      such things as conflict resolution are within the purview of D2 itself (<a class="xref" href="#dhcp-ddns-server" title="ChapterÂ 10.Â The DHCP-DDNS Server">ChapterÂ 10, <i>The DHCP-DDNS Server</i></a>).
      This section describes when kea-dhcp4 will generate NCRs and the
      configuration parameters that can be used to influence this decision.
      It assumes that the <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span> parameter is true.
      </p><p>
      In general, kea-dhcp4 will generate DDNS update requests when:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
      A new lease is granted in response to a DHCP REQUEST
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      An existing lease is renewed but the FQDN associated with it has
      changed.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      An existing lease is released in response to a DHCP RELEASE
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      In the second case, lease renewal, two  DDNS requests will be issued: one
      request to remove entries for the previous FQDN and a second request to
      add entries for the new FQDN.  In the last case, a lease release, a
      single DDNS request to remove its entries will be made.
      </p><p>
      The decision making involved when granting a new lease (the first case) is more
      involved.  When a new lease is granted, kea-dhcp4 will generate a DDNS
      update request if the DHCP REQUEST contains either the FQDN option
      (code 81) or the Host Name option (code 12). If both are present,
      the server will use the FQDN option. By default kea-dhcp4
      will respect the FQDN N and S flags specified by the client as shown
      in the following table:
      </p><div class="table"><a name="fqdn-flag-table"></a><p class="title"><b>TableÂ 7.4.Â Default FQDN Flag Behavior</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Default FQDN Flag Behavior" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left" class="cflags"><col align="left" class="meaning"><col align="left" class="response"><col align="left" class="sflags"></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Client Flags:N-S</th><th align="left">Client Intent</th><th align="left">Server Response</th><th align="left">Server Flags:N-S-O</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">0-0</td><td align="left">
                Client wants to do forward updates, server should do reverse updates
                </td><td align="left">Server generates reverse-only request</td><td align="left">1-0-0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">0-1</td><td align="left">Server should do both forward and reverse updates</td><td align="left">Server generates request to update both directions</td><td align="left">0-1-0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1-0</td><td align="left">Client wants no updates done</td><td align="left">Server does not generate a request</td><td align="left">1-0-0</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"><p>
      The first row in the table above represents "client delegation". Here
      the DHCP client states that it intends to do the forward DNS updates and
      the server should do the reverse updates.  By default, kea-dhcp4 will honor
      the client's wishes and generate a DDNS request to the D2 server to update only
      reverse DNS data.  The parameter <span class="command"><strong>override-client-update</strong></span> can be used
      to instruct the server to override client delegation requests.  When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp4 will disregard requests for client
      delegation and generate a DDNS request to update both forward and
      reverse DNS data.  In this case, the N-S-O flags in the server's
      response to the client will be 0-1-1 respectively.
      </p><p>
      (Note that the flag combination N=1, S=1 is prohibited according to
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4702" target="_top">RFC 4702</a>. If such a
      combination is received from the client, the packet will be dropped by kea-dhcp4.)
      </p><p>
      To override client delegation, set the following values in the configuration file:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"override-client-update": true</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The third row in the table above describes the case in which the client
      requests that no DNS updates be done. The parameter, <span class="command"><strong>override-no-update</strong></span>,
      can be used to instruct the server to disregard the client's wishes. When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp4 will generate DDNS update requests to kea-dhcp-ddns
      even if the client requests that no updates be done.  The N-S-O flags in the
      server's response to the client will be 0-1-1.
      </p><p>
      To override client delegation, the following values should be set in your configuration:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"override-no-update": true</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      kea-dhcp4 will always generate DDNS update requests if the client request
      only contains the Host Name option. In addition it will include an FQDN
      option in the response to the client with the FQDN N-S-O flags set to
      0-1-0 respectively. The domain name portion of the FQDN option will be
      the name submitted to D2 in the DDNS update request.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="dhcpv4-fqdn-name-generation"></a>7.2.15.3.Â kea-dhcp4 name generation for DDNS update requests</h4></div></div></div><p>Each NameChangeRequest must of course include the fully qualified domain
      name whose DNS entries are to be affected.  kea-dhcp4 can be configured to
      supply a portion or all of that name based upon what it receives from
      the client in the DHCP REQUEST.</p><p>
       The default rules for constructing the FQDN that will be used for DNS
       entries are:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
        If the DHCPREQUEST contains the client FQDN option, the candidate name
        is taken from there, otherwise it is taken from the Host Name option.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        If the candidate name is a partial (i.e. unqualified) name then add a
        configurable suffix to the name and use the result as the FQDN.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        If the candidate name provided is empty, generate a FQDN using a
        configurable prefix and suffix.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        If the client provided neither option, then no DNS action will be taken.
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
        These rules can amended by setting the
        <span class="command"><strong>replace-client-name</strong></span> parameter which provides the
        following modes of behavior:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>never</strong></span> - Use the name the client sent.  If the client
        sent no name, do not generate one.  This is the default mode.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>always</strong></span> - Replace the name the client sent. If the
        client sent no name, generate one for the client.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>when-present</strong></span> - Replace the name the client sent.
        If the client sent no name, do not generate one.

        <span class="command"><strong>when-not-present</strong></span> - Use the name the client sent.

      </p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
    Note that formerly, this parameter was a boolean and permitted only values
    of <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span>.  Boolean values
    will still be accepted but may eventually be deprecated. A value of
    <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> equates to <span class="command"><strong>when-present</strong></span>,
    <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span> equates to <span class="command"><strong>never</strong></span>.
    </div><p>

      For example, To instruct kea-dhcp4 to always generate the FQDN for a
      client, set the parameter <span class="command"><strong>replace-client-name</strong></span> to
      <span class="command"><strong>always</strong></span> as follows:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"replace-client-name": "always"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The prefix used in the generation of a FQDN is specified by the
      <span class="command"><strong>generated-prefix</strong></span> parameter.  The default value is "myhost".  To alter
      its value, simply set it to the desired string:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"generated-prefix": "another.host"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The suffix used when generating a FQDN or when qualifying a
      partial name is specified by
      the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> parameter. This
      parameter has no default value, thus it is mandatory when
      DDNS updates are enabled.
      To set its value simply set it to the desired string:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"qualifying-suffix": "foo.example.org"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre></div><p>
      When generating a name, kea-dhcp4 will construct name of the format:
      </p><p>
        [generated-prefix]-[address-text].[qualifying-suffix].
      </p><p>
      where address-text is simply the lease IP address converted to a
      hyphenated string.  For example, if the lease address is 172.16.1.10,
      the qualifying suffix "example.com", and the default value is used for
      <span class="command"><strong>generated-prefix</strong></span>, the generated FQDN would be:
      </p><p>
        myhost-172-16-1-10.example.com.

      The value in subnet can be set to 0.0.0.0, which means that <span class="command"><strong>next-server</strong></span> should

      other clients) from which it receives the message. There are many reasons
      why this identification is required and the most important ones are:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">When the client contacts the server to allocate a new
        lease, the server must store the client identification information in
        the lease database as a search key.</li><li class="listitem">When the client is trying to renew or release the existing
        lease, the server must be able to find the existing lease entry in the
        database for this client, using the client identification information as a
        search key.</li><li class="listitem">Some configurations use static reservations for the IP
        addresses and other configuration information. The server's administrator
        uses client identification information to create these static assignments.
        </li><li class="listitem">In the dual stack networks there is often a need to
        correlate the lease information stored in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 server for
        a particular host. Using common identification information by the DHCPv4
        and DHCPv6 client allows the network administrator to achieve this
        correlation and better administer the network.</li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>DHCPv4 makes use of two distinct identifiers which are placed
      by the client in the queries sent to the server and copied by the server
      to its responses to the client: "chaddr" and "client identifier". The
      former was introduced as a part of the BOOTP specification and it is also
      used by DHCP to carry the hardware address of the interface used to send
      the query to the server (MAC address for the Ethernet). The latter is
      carried in the Client-identifier option, introduced in
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132" target="_top">RFC 2132</a>.
      </p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131" target="_top">RFC 2131</a>
      indicates that the server may use both of these identifiers to identify
      the client but the "client identifier", if present, takes precedence
      over "chaddr". One of the reasons for this is that "client identifier"
      is independent from the hardware used by the client to communicate with
      the server. For example, if the client obtained the lease using one
      network card and then the network card is moved to another host, the
      server will wrongly identify this host is the one which has obtained
      the lease. Moreover,
      <a class="ulink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4361" target="_top">RFC 4361</a> gives
      the recommendation to use a DUID
      (see <a class="ulink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315" target="_top">RFC 3315</a>,
      the DHCPv6 specification)
      carried as "client identifier" when dual stack networks are in use
      to provide consistent identification information of the client, regardless
      of the protocol type it is using. Kea adheres to these specifications and
      the "client identifier" by default takes precedence over the value carried
      in "chaddr" field when the server searches, creates, updates or removes
      the client's lease.
      </p><p>When the server receives a DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST message from the
      client, it will try to find out if the client already has a lease in the
      database and will hand out that lease rather than allocate
      a new one. Each lease in the lease database is associated with the
      "client identifier" and/or "chaddr". The server will first use the
      "client identifier" (if present) to search the lease. If the lease is
      found, the server will treat this lease as belonging to the client
      even if the current "chaddr" and the "chaddr" associated with
      the lease do not match. This facilitates the scenario when the network card
      on the client system has been replaced and thus the new MAC address
      appears in the messages sent by the DHCP client. If the server fails
      to find the lease using the "client identifier" it will perform another lookup
      using the "chaddr". If this lookup returns no result, the client is
      considered as not having a lease and the new lease will be created.
      </p><p>A common problem reported by network operators is that poor
      client implementations do not use stable client identifiers, instead
      generating a new "client identifier" each time the client connects
      to the network. Another well known case is when the client changes its
      "client identifier" during the multi-stage boot process (PXE). In such
      cases, the MAC address of the client's interface remains stable and
      using "chaddr" field to identify the client guarantees that the
      particular system is considered to be the same client, even though its
      "client identifier" changes.
      </p><p>To address this problem, Kea includes a configuration option
      which enables client identification using "chaddr" only by instructing
      the server to disregard server to "ignore" the "client identifier" during
      lease lookups and allocations for a particular subnet. Consider the following
      simplified server configuration:</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    ...
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"match-client-id": true,</code></strong>
    ...
    "subnet4": [
    {
        "subnet": "192.0.10.0/24",
        "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.2.23-192.0.2.87" } ],
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"match-client-id": false</code></strong>
    },
    {
        "subnet": "10.0.0.0/8",
        "pools": [ { "pool": "10.0.0.23-10.0.2.99" } ],
    }
    ]
}
</pre><p>The <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> is a boolean value which
     controls this behavior. The default value of <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>
     indicates that the server will use the "client identifier" for lease
     lookups and "chaddr" if the first lookup returns no results. The
     <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span> means that the server will only
     use the "chaddr" to search for client"s lease. Whether the DHCID for
     DNS updates is generated from the "client identifier" or "chaddr" is
     controlled through the same parameter accordingly.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> parameter may appear
     both in the global configuration scope and/or under any subnet
     declaration. In the example shown above, the effective value of the
     <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> will be <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong>
     for the subnet 192.0.10.0/24, because the subnet specific setting
     of the parameter overrides the global value of the parameter. The
     effective value of the <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> for the subnet
     10.0.0.0/8 will be set to <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong> because the
     subnet declaration lacks this parameter and the global setting is
     by default used for this subnet. In fact, the global entry for this
     parameter could be omitted in this case, because
     <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong> is the default value.
     </p><p>It is important to explain what happens when the client obtains
     its lease for one setting of the <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span>
     and then renews when the setting has been changed. First consider
     the case when the client obtains the lease when the
     <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> is set to <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>.
     The server will store the lease information including "client identifier"
     (if supplied) and "chaddr" in the lease database. When the setting is
     changed and the client renews the lease the server will determine that
     it should use the "chaddr" to search for the existing lease. If the
     client hasn't changed its MAC address the server should successfully
     find the existing lease. The "client identifier" associated with the
     returned lease is ignored and the client is allowed to use this lease.
     When the lease is renewed only the "chaddr" is recorded for this
     lease according to the new server setting.
     </p><p>In the second case the client has the lease with only a "chaddr"
     value recorded. When the setting is changed to
     <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span> set to <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>
     the server will first try to use the "client identifier" to find the
     existing client's lease. This will return no results because the
     "client identifier" was not recorded for this lease. The server will
     then use the "chaddr" and the lease will be found. If the lease appears
     to have no "client identifier" recorded, the server will assume that
     this lease belongs to the client and that it was created with the previous
     setting of the <span class="command"><strong>match-client-id</strong></span>.
     However, if the lease contains "client identifier" which is different
     from the "client identifier" used by the client the lease will be
     assumed to belong to another client and the new lease will be
     allocated.

      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7341" target="_top">RFC 7341</a>
      and is implemented using cooperating DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers.
      This section is about the configuration of the DHCPv4 side
      (the DHCPv6 side is described in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-dhcp4o6-config" title="8.2.20.Â DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6: DHCPv6 Side">SectionÂ 8.2.20, âDHCPv4-over-DHCPv6: DHCPv6 Sideâ</a>).

      DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 support is experimental and the details of
      the inter-process communication can change: both the

      </div><p>
      The <span class="command"><strong>dhcp4o6-port</strong></span> global parameter specifies
      the first of the two consecutive ports of the UDP sockets used

      </p><p>
      With DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 the DHCPv4 server does not have access
      to several of the identifiers it would normally use to select a
      subnet.  In order to address this issue three new configuration
      entires have been added.  The presence of any of these allows the

    a per host basis. The most obvious one is to reserve a specific, static
    address for exclusive use by a given client (host) â the returning client will
    receive the same address from the server every time, and other clients will
    generally not receive that address.
    Another example when the host reservations are applicable is when a host
    has specific requirements, e.g. a printer that needs additional DHCP options.
    Yet another possible use case is to define unique names for hosts.</p><p>Note that there may be cases when the
    new reservation has been made for the client for the address being currently
    in use by another client. We call this situation a "conflict". The conflicts
    get resolved automatically over time as described in subsequent sections.
    Once the conflict is resolved, the client will keep receiving the reserved
    configuration when it renews.</p><p>Host reservations are defined as parameters for each subnet. Each host
    has to be identified by an identifier, for example the hardware/MAC address. There is an optional
    <span class="command"><strong>reservations</strong></span> array in the <span class="command"><strong>Subnet4</strong></span>
    element. Each element in that array is a structure that holds information
    about reservations for a single host. In particular, the structure has
    to have an identifier that uniquely identifies a host.  In the DHCPv4 context, the
    identifier is usually a hardware or MAC address.  In most cases an IP address
    will be specified. It is also possible to specify a hostname, host
    specific options or fields carried within DHCPv4 message such as siaddr,
    sname or file.</p><p>In Kea 1.0.0 it was only possible to create host reservations
    using client's hardware address. Host reservations by client
    identifier, DUID and circuit-id have been added in Kea 1.1.0.</p><p>The following example shows how to reserve addresses for specific
    hosts:

    The first entry reserves the 192.0.2.202 address for the client that uses
    a MAC address of 1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f. The second entry reserves the address
    192.0.2.100 and the hostname of alice-laptop for the client using a DUID
    0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f. (Note that if you plan to do DNS updates, it
    is strongly recommended for the hostnames to be unique.) The third
    example reserves address 192.0.3.203 to a client whose request
    would be relayed by a relay agent that inserts a circuid-it option
    with the value 'charter950'. The fourth entry reserves address
    192.0.2.204 for a client that uses a client identifier with value
    01:11:22:33:44:55:66.</p><p>The above example is used for ilustrational purposes only
    and in actual deployments it is recommended to use as few types as possible
    (preferably just one). See <a class="xref" href="#reservations4-tuning" title="7.3.9.Â Fine Tuning DHCPv4 Host Reservation">SectionÂ 7.3.9, âFine Tuning DHCPv4 Host Reservationâ</a> for a detailed
    discussion of this point.</p><p>Making a reservation for a mobile host that may visit multiple subnets
    requires a separate host definition in each subnet it is expected to visit.
    It is not allowed to define multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address in a single subnet. Multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address are valid if each is in a different subnet.
    </p><p>Adding host reservation incurs a performance penalty. In principle,
    when a server that does not support host reservation responds to a query,
    it needs to check whether there is a lease for a given address being
    considered for allocation or renewal. The server that also supports host
    reservation has to perform additional checks: not only if the address is
    currently used (i.e. if there is a lease for it), but also whether the address
    could be used by someone else (i.e. there is a reservation for it). That
    additional check incurs additional overhead.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation4-types"></a>7.3.1.Â Address Reservation Types</h3></div></div></div><p>In a typical scenario there is an IPv4 subnet defined,
      e.g. 192.0.2.0/24, with certain part of it dedicated for dynamic allocation
      by the DHCPv4 server. That dynamic part is referred to as a dynamic pool or
      simply a pool. In principle, a host reservation can reserve any address
      that belongs to the subnet. The reservations that specify addresses that
      belong to configured pools are called "in-pool reservations".
      In contrast, those that do not belong to dynamic pools are called
      "out-of-pool reservations". There is no formal difference
      in the reservation syntax and both reservation types are
      handled uniformly. However, upcoming releases may offer improved performance
      if there are only out-of-pool reservations as the server will be able
      to skip reservation checks when dealing with existing leases. Therefore,
      system administrators are encouraged to use out-of-pool reservations if
      possible.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation4-conflict"></a>7.3.2.Â Conflicts in DHCPv4 Reservations</h3></div></div></div><p>As the reservations and lease information are stored separately,
      conflicts may arise. Consider the following series of events. The server
      has configured the dynamic pool of addresses from the range of 192.0.2.10 to
      192.0.2.20. Host A requests an address and gets 192.0.2.10. Now the system
      administrator decides to reserve address 192.0.2.10 for Host B.
      In general, reserving an address that
      is currently assigned to someone else is not recommended, but there are
      valid use cases where such an operation is warranted.</p><p>The server now has a conflict to resolve. Let's analyze the
      situation here. If Host B boots up and requests an address, the server is
      not able to assign the reserved address 192.0.2.10. A naive approach
      would to be immediately remove the existing lease for the Host A
      and create a new one for the Host B. That would not solve the problem,
      though, because as soon as the Host B gets the address, it will detect
      that the address is already in use by the Host A and would send
      the DHCPDECLINE message. Therefore, in this situation, the server has
      to temporarily assign a different address (not matching what has been
      reserved) to the Host B.</p><p>When Host A renews its address, the server will discover that
      the address being renewed is now reserved for another host - Host
      B. Therefore the server will inform the Host A that it is no longer
      allowed to use it by sending a DHCPNAK message. The server will not remove the
      lease, though, as there's small chance that the DHCPNAK may be lost if the
      network is lossy. If that happens, the client will not receive any
      responses, so it will retransmit its DHCPREQUEST packet. Once the
      DHCPNAK is received by Host A, it will revert to the server
      discovery and will eventually get a different address. Besides
      allocating a new lease, the server will also remove the old one. As
      a result, address 192.0.2.10 will become free . When Host B
      tries to renew its temporarily assigned address, the server will detect
      that it has a valid lease, but there is a reservation for a different
      address. The server will send DHCPNAK to inform Host B that its address
      is no longer usable, but will keep its lease (again, the DHCPNAK may be
      lost, so the server will keep it, until the client returns for a new
      address). Host B will revert to the server discovery phase and will
      eventually send a DHCPREQUEST message. This time the server will find
      out that there is a reservation for that host and the reserved address
      192.0.2.10 is not used, so it will be granted. It will also remove the
      lease for the temporarily assigned address that Host B previously
      obtained.</p><p>This recovery will succeed, even if other hosts will attempt to get
      the reserved address. Had the Host C requested address 192.0.2.10 after
      the reservation was made, the server will either offer a different
      address (when responding to DHCPDISCOVER) or would send DHCPNAK
      (when responding to DHCPREQUEST).</p><p>This recovery mechanism allows the server to fully recover from a
      case where reservations conflict with the existing leases. This procedure
      takes time and will roughly take as long as the value set for of renew-timer.
      The best way to avoid such recovery is to not define new reservations that
      conflict with existing leases. Another recommendation is to use
      out-of-pool reservations. If the reserved address does not belong to a
      pool, there is no way that other clients could get this address.

      List option. The server will return the Hostname option even if it is not
      configured to perform DNS updates. The reserved hostname always takes
      precedence over the hostname supplied by the client or the autogenerated
      (from the IPv4 address) hostname.</p><p>The server qualifies the reserved hostname with the value
      of the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> parameter. For example, the
      following subnet configuration:

      will result in assigning the "alice-laptop.example.isc.org." hostname to the
      client using the MAC address "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff". If the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix

      allocation engine (the component of Kea that selects an address for a client)
      during lease selection and renewal. In particular, three
      major checks are necessary. First, when selecting a new lease, it is not
      sufficient for a candidate lease to not be used by another DHCP client. It
      also must not be reserved for another client. Second, when renewing a lease,
      additional check must be performed whether the address being renewed is not
      reserved for another client. Finally, when a host renews an address, the server
      has to check whether there is a reservation for this host, so the existing
      (dynamically allocated) address should be revoked and the reserved one be
      used instead.
      </p><p>Some of those checks may be unnecessary in certain deployments and not
      performing them may improve performance. The Kea server provides the
      <span class="command"><strong>reservation-mode</strong></span> configuration parameter to select the
      types of reservations allowed for the particular subnet. Each reservation
      type has different constraints for the checks to be performed by the
      server when allocating or renewing a lease for the client.
      Allowed values are:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"> <span class="command"><strong>all</strong></span> - enables all host reservation
      types. This is the default value. This setting is the safest and the most
      flexible. It allows in-pool and out-of-pool reservations. As all checks
      are conducted, it is also the slowest.
      </li><li class="listitem"> <span class="command"><strong>out-of-pool</strong></span> - allows only out of
      pool host reservations.  With this setting in place, the server may assume
      that all host reservations are for addresses that do not belong to the
      dynamic pool. Therefore it can skip the reservation checks when dealing
      with in-pool addresses, thus improving performance. Do not use this mode
      if any of your reservations use in-pool address. Caution is advised when
      using this setting: Kea 1.1.0 does not sanity check the reservations against
      <span class="command"><strong>reservation-mode</strong></span> and misconfiguration may cause problems.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>disabled</strong></span> - host reservation support is disabled. As there
      are no reservations, the server will skip all checks. Any reservations defined
      will be completely ignored. As the checks are skipped, the server may
      operate faster in this mode.
      </li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
        An example configuration that disables reservation looks like follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
    {
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"reservation-mode": "disabled"</code></strong>,
        ...
    }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
      </p><p>Another aspect of the host reservations are the different types of
      identifiers. Kea 1.1.0 supports four types of identifiers
      (hw-address, duid, client-id and circuit-id), but more identifier types
      are likely to be added in the future. This is beneficial from a
      usability perspective. However, there is a drawback. For each incoming
      packet Kea has to to extract each identifier type and then query the
      database to see if there is a reservation done by this particular
      identifier. If nothing is found, the next identifier is extracted and the next
      query is issued. This process continues until either a reservation is
      found or all identifier types have been checked. Over time with an increasing
      number of supported identifier types, Kea would become slower and
      slower.</p><p>To address this problem, a parameter called
      <span class="command"><strong>host-reservation-identifiers</strong></span> has been introduced. It
      takes a list of identifier types as a parameter. Kea will check only those
      identifier types enumerated in host-reservation-identifiers. From a
      performance perspective the number of identifier types should be kept to a
      minimum, ideally limited to one. If your deployment uses several
      reservation types, please enumerate them from most to least frequently
      used as this increases the chances of Kea finding the reservation using the
      fewest number of queries. An example of host reservation identifiers looks
      as follows:

</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>"host-reservation-identifiers": [ "circuit-id", "hw-address", "duid", "client-id" ],</code></strong>

    {
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
        ...
    }
]</pre><p>
</p><p>
If not specified, the default value is:
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>"host-reservation-identifiers": [ "hw-address", "duid", "circuit-id", "client-id" ]</code></strong>
</pre><p>


</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dhcp4-serverid"></a>7.4.Â Server Identifier in DHCPv4</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The DHCPv4 protocol uses a "server identifier" to allow clients
        to discriminate between several servers present on the same link: this
        value is an IPv4 address of the server. The server chooses the IPv4 address
        of the interface on which the message from the client (or relay) has been
        received. A single server instance will use multiple server identifiers
        if it is receiving queries on multiple interfaces.
      </p><p>
        Currently there is no mechanism to override the default server identifiers
        by an administrator. In the future, the configuration mechanism will be used
        to specify the custom server identifier.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dhcp4-subnet-selection"></a>7.5.Â How the DHCPv4 Server Selects a Subnet for the Client</h2></div></div></div><p>
        The DHCPv4 server differentiates between the directly connected clients,
        clients trying to renew leases and clients sending their messages through
        relays. For directly connected clients, the server will check the
        configuration for the interface on which the message has been received and,
        if the server configuration doesn't match any configured subnet, the
        message is discarded.</p><p>Assuming that the server's interface is configured with the
        IPv4 address 192.0.2.3, the server will only process messages received through
        this interface from a directly connected client if there is a subnet
        configured to which this IPv4 address belongs, e.g. 192.0.2.0/24.
        The server will use this subnet to assign IPv4 address for the client.
      </p><p>
        The rule above does not apply when the client unicasts its message, i.e.
        is trying to renew its lease. Such a message is accepted through any
        interface. The renewing client sets ciaddr to the currently used IPv4
        address. The server uses this address to select the subnet for the client
        (in particular, to extend the lease using this address).
      </p><p>
        If the message is relayed it is accepted through any interface. The giaddr
        set by the relay agent is used to select the subnet for the client.
      </p><p>
        It is also possible to specify a relay IPv4 address for a given subnet. It
        can be used to match incoming packets into a subnet in uncommon configurations,
        e.g. shared subnets. See <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-relay-override" title="7.5.1.Â Using a Specific Relay Agent for a Subnet">SectionÂ 7.5.1, âUsing a Specific Relay Agent for a Subnetâ</a> for details.

        on the assumption that client classification is not used. The classification
        mechanism alters the way in which a subnet is selected for the client,

        A relay has to have an interface connected to the link on which
        the clients are being configured. Typically the relay has an IPv4
        address configured on that interface that belongs to the subnet from which
        the server will assign addresses. In the typical case, the
        server is able to use the IPv4 address inserted by the relay (in the giaddr
        field of the DHCPv4 packet) to select the appropriate subnet.
      </p><p>
        However, that is not always the case. In certain uncommon â
        but valid â deployments, the relay address may not match the subnet. This
        usually means that there is more than one subnet allocated for a given
        link. The two most common examples where this is the case are long lasting
        network renumbering (where both old and new address space is still being
        used) and a cable network. In a cable network both cable modems and the
        devices behind them are physically connected to the same link, yet
        they use distinct addressing. In such a case, the DHCPv4 server needs
        additional information (the IPv4 address of the relay) to properly select
        an appropriate subnet.
      </p><p>
        The following example assumes that there is a subnet 192.0.2.0/24
        that is accessible via a relay that uses 10.0.0.1 as its IPv4 address.
        The server will be able to select this subnet for any incoming packets
        that came from a relay that has an address in 192.0.2.0/24 subnet.
        It will also select that subnet for a relay with address 10.0.0.1.

          One specific example is cable network, where typically modems
          get addresses from a different subnet than all devices connected
          behind them.
        </p><p>
          Let us assume that there is one CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System)
          with one CM MAC (a physical link that modems are connected to).
          We want the modems to get addresses from the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet, while
          everything connected behind modems should get addresses from another
          subnet (192.0.2.0/24). The CMTS that acts as a relay uses address

      that it is expected to hand out to the DHCPv4 clients.  It is
      assumed that the server is authoritative and has complete jurisdiction
      over those addresses. However, due to various reasons, such as
      misconfiguration or a faulty client implementation that retains its
      address beyond the valid lifetime, there may be devices connected that use
      those addresses without the server's approval or knowledge.</p><p>Such an
      unwelcome event can be detected by legitimate clients (using ARP or ICMP
      Echo Request mechanisms) and reported to the DHCPv4 server using a DHCPDECLINE
      message. The server will do a sanity check (if the client declining an
      address really was supposed to use it), and then will conduct a clean up
      operation. Any DNS entries related to that address will be removed, the
      fact will be logged and hooks will be triggered. After that is done, the
      address will be marked as declined (which indicates that it is used by an
      unknown entity and thus not available for assignment to anyone) and a
      probation time will be set on it. Unless otherwise configured, the
      probation period lasts 24 hours. After that period, the server will
      recover the lease (i.e. put it back into the available state) and the address will
      be available for assignment again. It should be noted that if the
      underlying issue of a misconfigured device is not resolved, the duplicate
      address scenario will repeat. On the other hand, it provides an
      opportunity to recover from such an event automatically, without any
      sysadmin intervention.</p><p>To configure the decline probation period to a value other
      than the default, the following syntax can be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
  "Dhcp4": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"decline-probation-period": 3600</code></strong>,
    "subnet4": [ ... ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The parameter is expressed in seconds, so the example above will instruct
      the server to recycle declined leases after an hour.</p><p>There are several statistics and hook points associated with the
      Decline handling procedure. The lease4_decline hook is triggered after the
      incoming DHCPDECLINE message has been sanitized and the server is about to
      decline the lease. The declined-addresses statistic is increased after the
      hook returns (both global and subnet specific variants). (See
      <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-stats" title="7.7.Â Statistics in the DHCPv4 Server">SectionÂ 7.7, âStatistics in the DHCPv4 Serverâ</a> and <a class="xref" href="#hooks-libraries" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Hooks Libraries">ChapterÂ 13, <i>Hooks Libraries</i></a> for more details
      on DHCPv4 statistics and Kea hook points.)</p><p>Once the probation time elapses, the declined lease is recovered
      using the standard expired lease reclamation procedure, with several
      additional steps. In particular, both declined-addresses statistics
      (global and subnet specific) are decreased. At the same time,
      reclaimed-declined-addresses statistics (again in two variants, global and
      subnet specific) are increased.</p><p>Note about statistics: The server does not decrease the
      assigned-addresses statistics when a DHCPDECLINE is received and processed
      successfully. While technically a declined address is no longer assigned,
      the primary usage of the assigned-addresses statistic is to monitor pool
      utilization. Most people would forget to include declined-addresses in the
      calculation, and simply do assigned-addresses/total-addresses. This would
      have a bias towards under-representing pool utilization. As this has a
      potential for major issues, we decided not to decrease assigned addresses
      immediately after receiving DHCPDECLINE, but to do it later when we
      recover the address back to the available pool.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dhcp4-stats"></a>7.7.Â Statistics in the DHCPv4 Server</h2></div></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This section describes DHCPv4-specific statistics.

        It is recommended that the Kea DHCPv6 server be started and stopped
        using <span class="command"><strong>keactrl</strong></span> (described in <a class="xref" href="#keactrl" title="ChapterÂ 6.Â Managing Kea with keactrl">ChapterÂ 6, <i>Managing Kea with keactrl</i></a>).
        However, it is also possible to run the server directly: it accepts
        the following command-line switches:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-c <em class="replaceable"><code>file</code></em></strong></span> -

            switch.</li><li class="listitem">
            <span class="command"><strong>-d</strong></span> - specifies whether the server
            logging should be switched to verbose mode. In verbose mode,
            the logging severity and debuglevel specified in the configuration
            file are ignored and "debug" severity and the maximum debuglevel
            (99) are assumed. The flag is convenient, for temporarily
            switching the server into maximum verbosity, e.g. when

            <span class="command"><strong>-p <em class="replaceable"><code>port</code></em></strong></span> -
            specifies UDP port on which the server will listen. This is only
            useful during testing, as a DHCPv6 server listening on
            ports other than the standard ones will not be able to
            handle regular DHCPv6 queries.</li><li class="listitem">

            </li></ul></div><p>
        The <code class="filename">config.report</code> may also be accessed more
        directly.  The following command may be used to extract this
        information.  The binary <strong class="userinput"><code>path</code></strong> may be found
        in the install directory or in the <code class="filename">.libs</code>
        subdirectory in the source tree. For example
        <code class="filename">kea/src/bin/dhcp6/.libs/kea-dhcp6</code>.

      </p><p>
        On start-up, the server will detect available network interfaces
        and will attempt to open UDP sockets on all interfaces
        mentioned in the configuration file.
        Since the DHCPv6 server opens privileged ports, it requires root
        access. Make sure you run this daemon as root.
      </p><p>
        During startup the server will attempt to create a PID file of the
        form: localstatedir]/[conf name].kea-dhcp6.pid where:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>localstatedir</strong></span>: The value as passed into the
            build configure script. It defaults to "/usr/local/var".  Note
            that this value may be overridden at run time by setting the environment
            variable KEA_PIDFILE_DIR.  This is intended primarily for testing purposes.
            </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>conf name</strong></span>: The configuration file name
            used to start the server, minus all preceding path and file extension.
            For example, given a pathname of "/usr/local/etc/kea/myconf.txt", the
            portion used would be "myconf".
            </li></ul></div><p>
        If the file already exists and contains the PID of a live process,
        the server will issue a DHCP6_ALREADY_RUNNING log message and exit. It
        is possible, though unlikely, that the file is a remnant of a system crash
        and the process to which the PID belongs is unrelated to Kea.  In such a
        case it would be necessary to manually delete the PID file.
      </p><p>
        The server can be stopped using the <span class="command"><strong>kill</strong></span> command.
        When running in a console, the server can be shut down by
        pressing ctrl-c. It detects the key combination and shuts
        down gracefully.

        This section explains how to configure the DHCPv6 server using the
        Kea configuration backend. (Kea configuration using any other
        backends is outside of scope of this document.) Before DHCPv6
        is started, its configuration file has to be created. The
        basic configuration is as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
# DHCPv6 configuration starts on the next line
"Dhcp6": {

# First we set up global values
    "valid-lifetime": 4000,
    "renew-timer": 1000,
    "rebind-timer": 2000,
    "preferred-lifetime": 3000,

# Next we setup the interfaces to be used by the server.
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ "eth0" ]
    },

# And we specify the type of lease database
    "lease-database": {
        "type": "memfile",
        "persist": true,
        "name": "/var/kea/dhcp6.leases"
    },

# Finally, we list the subnets from which we will be leasing addresses.
    "subnet6": [
        {
            "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
            "pools": [
                 {
                     "pool": "2001:db8:1::1-2001:db8:1::ffff"
                 }
             ]
        }
    ]
# DHCPv6 configuration ends with the next line
}

} </pre><p>
</p><p>The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the parameters in
the above example together with
their format. Subsequent sections of this chapter go into much greater detail
for these and other parameters.</p><p>The lines starting with a hash (#) are comments and are ignored by
the server; they do not impact its
operation in any way.</p><p>The configuration starts in the first line with the initial
opening curly bracket (or brace). Each configuration consists of
one or more objects. In this specific example, we have only one
object, called Dhcp6. This is a simplified configuration, as usually
there will be additional objects, like <span class="command"><strong>Logging</strong></span> or
<span class="command"><strong>DhcpDns</strong></span>, but we omit them now for clarity. The Dhcp6
configuration starts with the <span class="command"><strong>"Dhcp6": {</strong></span> line
and ends with the corresponding closing brace (in the above example,
the brace after the last comment).  Everything defined between those
lines is considered to be the Dhcp6 configuration.</p><p>In the general case, the order in which those parameters appear does not
matter. There are two caveats here though. The first one is to remember that
the configuration file must be well formed JSON. That means that parameters
for any given scope must be separated by a comma and there must not be a comma
after the last parameter. When reordering a configuration file, keep in mind that
moving a parameter to or from the last position in a given scope may also require
moving the comma. The second caveat is that it is uncommon â although
legal JSON â to
repeat the same parameter multiple times. If that happens, the last occurrence of a
given parameter in a given scope is used while all previous instances are
ignored. This is unlikely to cause any confusion as there are no real life
reasons to keep multiple copies of the same parameter in your configuration
file.</p><p>Moving onto the DHCPv6 configuration elements, the very first few elements
define some global parameters. <span class="command"><strong>valid-lifetime</strong></span>
defines for how long the addresses (leases) given out by the server are valid. If
nothing changes, a client that got an address is allowed to use it for 4000
seconds. (Note that integer numbers are specified as is, without any quotes
around them.) The address will become deprecated in 3000 seconds (clients are
allowed to keep old connections, but can't use this address for creating new
connections). <span class="command"><strong>renew-timer</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong> rebind-timer</strong></span> are values that define T1 and T2 timers that
govern when the client will begin the renewal and rebind procedures.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>interfaces-config</strong></span> map specifies the server
configuration concerning the network interfaces, on which the server should
listen to the DHCP messages. The <span class="command"><strong>interfaces</strong></span> parameter
specifies a list of network interfaces on which the server should listen.
Lists are opened and closed with square brackets, with elements separated
by commas. Had we wanted to listen on two interfaces, the
<span class="command"><strong>interfaces-config</strong></span> would look like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
"interfaces-config": {
    "interfaces": [ "eth0", "eth1" ]
},
</pre><p>
</p><p>The next couple of lines define the lease database, the place where the server
stores its lease information. This particular example tells the server to use
<span class="command"><strong>memfile</strong></span>, which is the simplest (and fastest) database
backend. It uses an in-memory database and stores leases on disk in a CSV
file. This is a very simple configuration. Usually the lease database configuration
is more extensive and contains additional parameters.  Note that
<span class="command"><strong>lease-database</strong></span>
is an object and opens up a new scope, using an opening brace.
Its parameters (just one in this example - <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span>)
follow. Had there been more than one, they would be separated by commas. This
scope is closed with a closing brace. As more parameters for the Dhcp6 definition
follow, a trailing comma is present.</p><p>Finally, we need to define a list of IPv6 subnets. This is the
most important DHCPv6 configuration structure as the server uses that
information to process clients' requests. It defines all subnets from
which the server is expected to receive DHCP requests. The subnets are
specified with the <span class="command"><strong>subnet6</strong></span> parameter.  It is a list,
so it starts and ends with square brackets.  Each subnet definition in
the list has several attributes associated with it, so it is a structure
and is opened and closed with braces. At minimum, a subnet definition
has to have at least two parameters: <span class="command"><strong>subnet</strong></span> (that
defines the whole subnet) and <span class="command"><strong>pools</strong></span> (which is a list of
dynamically allocated pools that are governed by the DHCP server).</p><p>The example contains a single subnet. Had more than one been defined,
additional elements
in the <span class="command"><strong>subnet6</strong></span> parameter would be specified and
separated by commas. For example, to define two subnets, the following
syntax would be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
"subnet6": [
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool": "2001:db8:1::/112" } ],
        "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64"
    },
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool": "2001:db8:2::1-2001:db8:2::ffff" } ],
        "subnet": "2001:db8:2::/64"
    }
]
</pre><p>
Note that indentation is optional and is used for aesthetic purposes only.
In some cases in may be preferable to use more compact notation.
</p><p>After all parameters are specified, we have two contexts open:
global and Dhcp6, hence we need two closing curly brackets to close them.
In a real life configuration file there most likely would be additional
components defined such as Logging or DhcpDdns, so the closing brace would
be followed by a comma and another object definition.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54817104"></a>8.2.2.Â Lease Storage</h3></div></div></div><p>All leases issued by the server are stored in the lease database.
  Currently there are four database backends available:  memfile (which is the
  default backend), MySQL, PostgreSQL and Cassandra.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp54818464"></a>8.2.2.1.Â Memfile - Basic Storage for Leases</h4></div></div></div><p>The server is able to store lease data in different repositories. Larger
  deployments may elect to store leases in a database. <a class="xref" href="#database-configuration6" title="8.2.2.2.Â Lease Database Configuration">SectionÂ 8.2.2.2, âLease Database Configurationâ</a> describes this option. In typical
  smaller deployments though, the server will store lease information in a CSV file rather
  than a database. As well as requiring less administration, an
  advantage of using a file for storage is that it
  eliminates a dependency on third-party database software.</p><p>The configuration of the file backend (Memfile) is controlled through
  the Dhcp6/lease-database parameters. The <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> parameter
  is mandatory and it specifies which storage for leases the server should use.
  The value of <strong class="userinput"><code>"memfile"</code></strong> indicates that the file should
  be used as the storage. The following list gives additional, optional,
  parameters that can be used to configure the Memfile backend.

  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>persist</strong></span>: controls whether the new leases and
      updates to existing leases are written to the file. It is strongly
      recommended that the value of this parameter is set to
      <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong> at all times, during the server's normal
      operation. Not writing leases to disk will mean that if a server is restarted
      (e.g. after a power failure), it will not know what addresses have been
      assigned.  As a result, it may hand out addresses to new clients that are
      already in use. The value of <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong> is mostly useful
      for performance testing purposes. The default value of the
      <span class="command"><strong>persist</strong></span> parameter is <strong class="userinput"><code>true</code></strong>,
      which enables writing lease updates
      to the lease file.
      </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>: specifies an absolute location of the lease
      file in which new leases and lease updates will be recorded. The default value
      for this parameter is <strong class="userinput"><code>"[kea-install-dir]/var/kea/kea-leases6.csv"
      </code></strong>.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span>: specifies the interval in seconds, at
      which the server will perform a lease file cleanup (LFC).  This
      removes redundant (historical) information from the lease file
      and effectively reduces the lease file size. The cleanup process is described
      in more detailed fashion further in this section. The default value of the
      <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> is <strong class="userinput"><code>0</code></strong>, which disables
      the LFC.</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>An example configuration of the Memfile backend is presented below:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "lease-database": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"type": "memfile"</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"persist": true</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "/tmp/kea-leases6.csv"</code></strong>,
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"lfc-interval": 1800</code></strong>
    }
}
</pre><p>

    This configuration selects the <code class="filename">/tmp/kea-leases6.csv</code> as
    the storage for lease information and enables persistence (writing lease updates
    to this file). It also configures the backend perform the periodic cleanup
    of the lease files, executed every 30 minutes.
  </p><p>It is important to know how the lease file contents are organized
  to understand why the periodic lease file cleanup is needed. Every time
  the server updates a lease or creates a new lease for the client, the new
  lease information must be recorded in the lease file. For performance reasons,
  the server does not update the existing client's lease in the file, as it would
  potentially require rewriting the entire file. Instead, it simply appends the new lease
  information to the end of the file: the previous lease entries for the
  client are not removed. When the server loads leases from the lease file, e.g.
  at the server startup, it assumes that the latest lease entry for the client
  is the valid one. The previous entries are discarded. This means that the
  server can re-construct the accurate information about the leases even though
  there may be many lease entries for each client. However, storing many entries
  for each client results in bloated lease file and impairs the performance of
  the server's startup and reconfiguration as it needs to process a larger number
  of lease entries.
  </p><p>Lease file cleanup (LFC) removes all previous entries for each client and
  leaves only the latest ones. The interval at which the cleanup is performed
  is configurable, and it should be selected according to the frequency of lease
  renewals initiated by the clients. The more frequent the renewals, the smaller
  the value of <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> should be. Note however, that the
  LFC takes time and thus it is possible (although unlikely) that new cleanup
  is started while the previous cleanup instance is still running, if the
  <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> is too short. The server would recover from
  this by skipping the new cleanup when it detects that the previous cleanup
  is still in progress. But it implies that the actual cleanups will be
  triggered more rarely than configured. Moreover, triggering a new cleanup
  adds an overhead to the server which will not be able to respond to new
  requests for a short period of time when the new cleanup process is spawned.
  Therefore, it is recommended that the <span class="command"><strong>lfc-interval</strong></span> value
  is selected in a way that would allow for the LFC to complete the cleanup before a
  new cleanup is triggered.
  </p><p>Lease file cleanup is performed by a separate process (in background) to avoid
  a performance impact on the server process. In order to avoid the conflicts
  between two processes both using the same lease files, the LFC process
  operates on the copy of the original lease file, rather than on the lease
  file used by the server to record lease updates. There are also other files
  being created as a side effect of the lease file cleanup. The detailed
  description of the LFC is located on the Kea wiki:
  <a class="ulink" href="http://kea.isc.org/wiki/LFCDesign" target="_top">http://kea.isc.org/wiki/LFCDesign</a>.

In some deployments the database user whose name is specified in the database backend
configuration may not have write privileges to the database. This is often
required by the policy within a given network to secure the data from being
unintentionally modified. In many cases administrators have inventory databases
deployed, which contain substantially more information about the hosts than
static reservations assigned to them. The inventory database can be used to create
a view of a Kea hosts database and such view is often read only.
</p><p>
Kea host database backends operate with an implicit configuration to both
read from and write to the database. If the database user does not have
write access to the host database, the backend will fail to start and the
server will refuse to start (or reconfigure). However, if access to a read
only host database is required for retrieving reservations for clients
and/or assign specific addresses and options, it is possible to explicitly
configure Kea to start in "read-only" mode. This is controlled by the
<span class="command"><strong>readonly</strong></span> boolean parameter as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { "hosts-database": { <strong class="userinput"><code>"readonly": true</code></strong>, ... }, ... }
</pre><p>
Setting this parameter to <strong class="userinput"><code>false</code></strong> would configure the
database backend to operate in "read-write" mode, which is also a default
configuration if the parameter is not specified.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The <span class="command"><strong>readonly</strong></span> parameter is currently only supported

        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"*"</code></strong> ]

  The asterisk plays the role of a wildcard and means "listen on all interfaces".

  </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ipv6-subnet-id"></a>8.2.5.Â IPv6 Subnet Identifier</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The subnet identifier is a unique number associated with a particular subnet.
        In principle, it is used to associate clients' leases with their respective subnets.
        When a subnet identifier is not specified for a subnet being configured, it will
        be automatically assigned by the configuration mechanism. The identifiers
        are assigned from 1 and are monotonically increased for each subsequent
        subnet: 1, 2, 3 ....
      </p><p>
        If there are multiple subnets configured with auto-generated identifiers and
        one of them is removed, the subnet identifiers may be renumbered. For example:
        if there are four subnets and the third is removed the last subnet will be assigned
        the identifier that the third subnet had before removal. As a result, the leases
        stored in the lease database for subnet 3 are now associated with
        subnet 4, something that may have unexpected consequences. It is planned
        to implement a mechanism to preserve auto-generated subnet ids in a
        future version of Kea.  However, the only remedy for this issue
        at present is to
        manually specify a unique identifier for each subnet.
      </p><p>
        The following configuration will assign the specified subnet
        identifier to the newly configured subnet:

        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "subnet6": [
        {
            "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"id": 1024</code></strong>,
            ...
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
        This identifier will not change for this subnet unless the "id" parameter is
        removed or set to 0. The value of 0 forces auto-generation of the subnet
        identifier.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp6-unicast"></a>8.2.6.Â Unicast Traffic Support</h3></div></div></div><p>
        When the DHCPv6 server starts, by default it listens to the DHCP traffic
        sent to multicast address ff02::1:2 on each interface that it is
        configured to listen on (see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-interface-selection" title="8.2.4.Â Interface Selection">SectionÂ 8.2.4, âInterface Selectionâ</a>).
        In some cases it is useful to configure a server to handle incoming
        traffic sent to the global unicast addresses as well. The most common
        reason for this is to have relays send their traffic to the server
        directly. To configure the server to listen on a specific unicast address,
        nn interface name can be
        optionally followed by a slash, followed by the global unicast address on which
        the server should listen. The server listens to this address in addition to normal
        link-local binding and listening on ff02::1:2 address. The sample configuration
        below shows how to listen on 2001:db8::1 (a global address)
        configured on the eth1 interface.
      </p><p>
 </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <strong class="userinput"><code>"eth1/2001:db8::1"</code></strong> ]
    },
    ...
    "option-data": [
        {
            "name": "unicast",
            "data": "2001:db8::1"
        } ],
    ...
}
 </pre><p>

        This configuration will cause the server to listen on
        eth1 on the link-local address, the multicast group (ff02::1:2) and 2001:db8::1.
      </p><p>
        Usually unicast support is associated with a server unicast option
        which allows clients to send unicast messages to the server.
        The example above includes a server unicast option specification
        which will cause the client to send messages to the specified
        unicast address.
      </p><p>
        It is possible to mix interface names, wildcards and interface name/addresses
        in the list of interfaces. It is not possible however to specify more than one
        unicast address on a given interface.
      </p><p>
        Care should be taken to specify proper unicast addresses. The server will
        attempt to bind to the addresses specified without any additional checks.
        This approach has selected on purpose to allow the software to
        communicate over uncommon addresses if so desired.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp6-address-config"></a>8.2.7.Â Subnet and Address Pool</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The main role of a DHCPv6 server is address assignment. For this,
        the server has to be configured with at least one subnet and one pool of dynamic
        addresses to be managed. For example, assume that the server
        is connected to a network segment that uses the 2001:db8:1::/64
        prefix. The Administrator of that network has decided that addresses from range
        2001:db8:1::1 to 2001:db8:1::ffff are going to be managed by the Dhcp6
        server. Such a configuration can be achieved in the following way:
        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"subnet6": [
       {
           "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
           "pools": [
               {
                   "pool": "2001:db8:1::1-2001:db8:1::ffff"
               }
           ],
           ...
       }
    ]</code></strong>
}</pre><p>

        Note that <span class="command"><strong>subnet</strong></span> is defined as a simple string, but
        the <span class="command"><strong>pools</strong></span> parameter is actually a list of pools: for
        this reason, the pool definition is enclosed in square brackets, even
        though only one range of addresses is specified.</p><p>Each <span class="command"><strong>pool</strong></span> is a structure that contains the
        parameters that describe a single pool. Currently there is only one
        parameter, <span class="command"><strong>pool</strong></span>, which gives the range of addresses
        in the pool. Additional parameters will be added in future releases of
        Kea.</p><p>It is possible to define more than one pool in a
        subnet: continuing the previous example, further assume that
        2001:db8:1:0:5::/80 should also be managed by the server. It could be written as
        2001:db8:1:0:5:: to 2001:db8:1::5:ffff:ffff:ffff, but typing so many 'f's
        is cumbersome. It can be expressed more simply as 2001:db8:1:0:5::/80. Both
        formats are supported by Dhcp6 and can be mixed in the pool list.
        For example, one could define the following pools:
        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"subnet6": [
    {
        "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
        "pools": [
            { "pool": "2001:db8:1::1-2001:db8:1::ffff" },
            { "pool": "2001:db8:1:05::/80" }
        ]</code></strong>,
        ...
    }
    ]
}</pre><p>
        White space in pool definitions is ignored, so spaces before and after the hyphen are optional.
        They can be used to improve readability.
      </p><p>
        The number of pools is not limited, but for performance reasons it is recommended to
        use as few as possible.
      </p><p>
         The server may be configured to serve more than one subnet. To add a second subnet,
         use a command similar to the following:
        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"subnet6": [
    {
        "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",
        "pools": [
            { "pool": "2001:db8:1::1-2001:db8:1::ffff" }
        ]
    },
    {
        "subnet": "2001:db8:2::/64",
        "pools": [
            { "pool": "2001:db8:2::/64" }
        ]
    },
</code></strong>
        ...
    ]
}</pre><p>
        In this example, we allow the server to
        dynamically assign all addresses available in the whole subnet. Although
        rather wasteful, it is certainly a valid configuration to dedicate the
        whole /64 subnet for that purpose. Note that the Kea server does not preallocate
        the leases, so there is no danger in using gigantic address pools.
      </p><p>
        When configuring a DHCPv6 server using prefix/length notation, please pay
        attention to the boundary values. When specifying that the server can use
        a given pool, it will also be able to allocate the first (typically network
        address) address from that pool. For example, for pool 2001:db8:2::/64 the
        2001:db8:2:: address may be assigned as well. If you want to avoid this,
        use the "min-max" notation.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp55492912"></a>8.2.8.Â Subnet and Prefix Delegation Pools</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Subnets may also be configured to delegate prefixes, as defined in
        <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3633" target="_top">RFC 3633</a>.  A
        subnet may have one or more prefix delegation pools.  Each pool has a
        prefixed address, which is specified as a prefix
        (<span class="command"><strong>prefix</strong></span>) and a prefix length
        (<span class="command"><strong>prefix-len</strong></span>), as well as a delegated prefix length
        (<span class="command"><strong>delegated-len</strong></span>). The delegated length must not be
        shorter (that is it must be numerically greater or equal) than the
        prefix length.  If both the delegated and prefix lengths are equal, the
        server will be able to delegate only one prefix. The delegated prefix
        does not have to match the subnet prefix.
      </p><p> Below is a sample subnet configuration which enables prefix
      delegation for the subnet:

        One of the major features of a DHCPv6 server is to provide configuration
        options to clients.  Although there are several options that require
        special behavior, most options are sent by the server only if the client
        explicitly requests them.  The following example shows how to
        configure DNS servers, one of the most frequently used
        options.  Options specified in this way are considered
        global and apply to all configured subnets.

      The <span class="command"><strong>option-data</strong></span> line creates a new entry in
      the option-data table.  This table contains
      information on all global options that the server is supposed to configure
      in all subnets.  The <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> line specifies the option name.
      (For a complete list

      which the data will be entered: use of CSV (comma separated values) is
      recommended. Finally, the <span class="command"><strong>data</strong></span> line gives the actual value to be sent to

      It is possible to override options on a per-subnet basis.  If
      clients connected to most of your subnets are expected to get the
      same values of a given option, you should use global options: you
      can then override specific values for a small number of subnets.
      On the other hand, if you use different values in each subnet,
      it does not make sense to specify global option values
      (Dhcp6/option-data), rather you should set only subnet-specific values
      (Dhcp6/subnet[X]/option-data[Y]).

      Some options are designated as arrays, which means that more than one
      value is allowed in such an option. For example the option dns-servers

      Assume that we want to define a new DHCPv6 option called "foo" which will have
      code 100 and which will convey a single unsigned 32 bit integer value. We can define
      such an option by using the following commands:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "foo",

            "record-types": "",

            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }, ...
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The "false" value of the <span class="command"><strong>array</strong></span> parameter determines that the option does
      NOT comprise an array of "uint32" values but rather a single value.  Two
      other parameters have been left blank: <span class="command"><strong>record-types</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span>.
      The former specifies the comma separated list of option data fields if the
      option comprises a record of data fields. The <span class="command"><strong>record-types</strong></span> value should
      be non-empty if the <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> is set to "record". Otherwise it must be left
      blank. The latter parameter specifies the name of the option space being
      encapsulated by the particular option. If the particular option does not
      encapsulate any option space it should be left blank.  Note that the above
      example only defines the format of the new option, it does not set its
      value(s).
      </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>code</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> parameters are required, all others are

      and <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span> default values are blank
      (i.e. ""). The default <span class="command"><strong>space</strong></span> is "dhcp6".
      </p><p>Once the new option format is defined, its value is set
      in the same way as for a standard option. For example the following
      commands set a global value that applies to all subnets.

      For example, assume we want to define a new option that will consist of an IPv6
      address, followed by an unsigned 16 bit integer, followed by a

      be defined in the following way:

            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }, ...
    ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The "type" is set to "record" to indicate that the option contains
      multiple values of different types.  These types are given as a comma-separated
      list in the "record-types" field and should be those listed in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp-types" title="TableÂ 7.3.Â List of standard DHCP option types">TableÂ 7.3, âList of standard DHCP option typesâ</a>.
      </p><p>
      The values of the option are set as follows:

      <span class="command"><strong>csv-format</strong></span> is set <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> to indicate

      Currently there are two option spaces defined for the DHCPv6
      daemon: "dhcp6" (for top level DHCPv6 options) and "vendor-opts-space",
      which is empty by default, but in which options can be defined.
      Those options will be carried in the Vendor-Specific
      Information option (code 17). The following examples show how to
      define an option "foo" with code 1 that consists of an IPv6 address,
      an unsigned 16 bit integer and a string. The "foo" option is
      conveyed in a Vendor-Specific Information option. This option
      comprises a single uint32 value that is set to "12345".
      The sub-option "foo" follows the data field holding this value.

     (Note that the option space is set to <span class="command"><strong>vendor-opts-space</strong></span>.)

      convey sub-options that use a separate numbering scheme, for
      example sub-options with codes 1 and 2. Those option codes
      conflict with standard DHCPv6 options, so a separate option
      space must be defined.
      </p><p>Note that it is not required to create a new option space when
      defining sub-options for a standard option because it is
      created by default if the standard option is meant to convey
      any sub-options (see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-vendor-opts" title="8.2.11.Â DHCPv6 Vendor-Specific Options">SectionÂ 8.2.11, âDHCPv6 Vendor-Specific Optionsâ</a>).

      Assume that we want to have a DHCPv6 option called "container"
      with code 102 that conveys two sub-options with codes 1 and 2.
      First we need to define the new sub-options:
</p><pre class="screen">

    "option-def": [
        {
            <strong class="userinput"><code>"name": "subopt1",

            "space": "isc",
            "type": "ipv6-address",
            "record-types": "",
            "array": false,
            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        },
        {

            "encapsulate": ""</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>
    Note that we have defined the options to belong to a new option space
    (in this case, "isc").
    </p><p>
The next step is to define a regular DHCPv6 option and specify that it
should include options from the isc option space:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "option-def": [
        ...,
        {

            "type": "empty",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "",
            "encapsulate": "isc"</code></strong>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</pre><p>

    The name of the option space in which the sub-options are defined is set in
    the <span class="command"><strong>encapsulate</strong></span> field. The <span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span> field
    is set to <span class="command"><strong>empty</strong></span> which limits this option to only carrying
    data in sub-options.
    </p><p>
    Finally, we can set values for the new options:
</p><pre class="screen">

    "option-data": [

        },

    value would have to be set to "uint16" in the option definition. (Such an
    option would then have the following data structure: DHCP header, uint16
    value, sub-options.) The value specified with the "data" parameter â which
    should be a valid integer enclosed in quotes, e.g. "123" â would then be
    assigned to the uint16 field in the "container" option.

      an option configuration and the default values can be used. However, it is
      important to understand the implications of not specifying some of them
      as it may result in configuration errors. The list below explains
      the behavior of the server when a particular parameter is not explicitly
      specified:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> - the server requires an option name or
          option code to identify an option. If this parameter is unspecified, the
          option code must be specified.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>code</strong></span> - the server requires an option name or
          option code to identify an option. This parameter may be left unspecified if
          the <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> parameter is specified. However, this also
          requires that the particular option has its definition (it is either a
          standard option or an administrator created a definition for the option
          using an 'option-def' structure), as the option definition associates an
          option with a particular name. It is possible to configure an option
          for which there is no definition (unspecified option format).
          Configuration of such options requires the use of option code.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>space</strong></span> - if the option space is unspecified it
          will default to 'dhcp6' which is an option space holding DHCPv6 standard
          options.
          </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>data</strong></span> - if the option data is unspecified it
          defaults to an empty value. The empty value is mostly used for the
          options which have no payload (boolean options), but it is legal to specify
          empty values for some options which carry variable length data and which
          spec allows for the length of 0. For such options, the data parameter
          may be omitted in the configuration.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>csv-format</strong></span> - if this value is not specified
          and the definition for the particular option exists, the server will assume
          that the option data is specified as a list of comma separated values to be
          assigned to individual fields of the DHCP option. If the definition
          does not exist for this option, the server will assume that the data
          parameter contains the option payload in the binary format (represented
          as a string of hexadecimal digits). Note that not specifying this
          parameter doesn't imply that it defaults to a fixed value, but
          the configuration data interpretation also depends on the presence
          of the option definition. An administrator must be aware if the
          definition for the particular option exists when this parameter
          is not specified. It is generally recommended to not specify this
          parameter only for the options for which the definition exists, e.g.
          standard options. Setting <span class="command"><strong>csv-format</strong></span> to an explicit
          value will cause the server to strictly check the format of the option
          data specified.

        The DHCPv6 server may receive requests from local (connected to the
        same subnet as the server) and remote (connecting via relays) clients.
        As the server may have many subnet configurations defined, it must select
        an appropriate subnet for a given request.
      </p><p>
        The server can not assume which of the configured subnets are local. In IPv4
        it is possible as there is a reasonable expectation that the
        server will have a (global) IPv4 address configured on the interface,
        and can use that information to detect whether a subnet is local or
        not. That assumption is not true in IPv6: the DHCPv6 server must be able
        to operate while only using link-local addresses. Therefore an optional
        <span class="command"><strong>interface</strong></span> parameter is available within a subnet definition
        to designate that a given subnet is local, i.e. reachable directly over
        the specified interface. For example the server that is intended to serve
        a local subnet over eth0 may be configured as follows:
        </p><pre class="screen">

          For clients connected to other subnets, the server will ignore the
          Rapid Commit option sent by the client and will follow the 4-way
          exchange procedure, i.e. respond with an Advertise for a Solicit
          containing a Rapid Commit option.

          A DHCPv6 server with multiple subnets defined must select the
          appropriate subnet when it receives a request from a client.  For clients
          connected via relays, two mechanisms are used:
        </p><p>
          The first uses the linkaddr field in the RELAY_FORW message. The name
          of this field is somewhat misleading in that it does not contain a link-layer
          address: instead, it holds an address (typically a global address) that is
          used to identify a link. The DHCPv6 server checks if the address belongs
          to a defined subnet and, if it does, that subnet is selected for the client's
          request.
        </p><p>
          The second mechanism is based on interface-id options. While forwarding a client's
          message, relays may insert an interface-id option into the message that
          identifies the interface on the relay that received the message. (Some
          relays allow configuration of that parameter, but it is sometimes
          hardcoded and may range from the very simple (e.g. "vlan100") to the very cryptic:
          one example seen on real hardware was "ISAM144|299|ipv6|nt:vp:1:110"). The
          server can use this information to select the appropriate subnet.
          The information is also returned to the relay which then knows the
          interface to use to transmit the response to the client. In order for
          this to work successfully, the relay interface IDs must be unique within
          the network and the server configuration must match those values.
        </p><p>
          When configuring the DHCPv6 server, it should be noted that two
          similarly-named parameters can be configured for a subnet:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
              <span class="command"><strong>interface</strong></span> defines which local network interface can be used
              to access a given subnet.
            </li><li class="listitem">
              <span class="command"><strong>interface-id</strong></span> specifies the content of the interface-id option
              used by relays to identify the interface on the relay to which
              the response packet is sent.
            </li></ul></div><p>
          The two are mutually exclusive: a subnet cannot be both reachable locally
          (direct traffic) and via relays (remote traffic). Specifying both is a
          configuration error and the DHCPv6 server will refuse such a configuration.
        </p><p>
          The following example configuration shows how to specify an interface-id with
          a value of "vlan123".
          </p><pre class="screen">

      defines a mechanism called Relay-Supplied DHCP Options. In certain cases relay
      agents are the only entities that may have specific information. They can
      insert options when relaying messages from the client to the server. The
      server will then do certain checks and copy those options to the response
      that will be sent to the client.</p><p>There are certain conditions that must be met for the option to be
      included. First, the server must not provide the option itself. In
      other words, if both relay and server provide an option, the server always
      takes precedence. Second, the option must be RSOO-enabled. IANA maintains a
      list of RSOO-enabled options <a class="ulink" href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xhtml#options-relay-supplied" target="_top">here</a>.
      However, there may be cases when system administrators want to echo other
      options. Kea can be instructed to treat other options as RSOO-enabled.
      For example, to mark options 110, 120 and 130 as RSOO-enabled, the following
      syntax should be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"relay-supplied-options": [ "110", "120", "130" ],</code></strong>
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      </p><p>As of March 2015, only option 65 is RSOO-enabled by IANA. This
      option will always be treated as such and there's no need to explicitly
      mark it. Also, when enabling standard options, it is possible to use their
      names, rather than option code, e.g. (e.g. use
      <span class="command"><strong>dns-servers</strong></span> instead of <span class="command"><strong>23</strong></span>). See
      <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-std-options-list" title="TableÂ 8.1.Â List of Standard DHCPv6 Options">TableÂ 8.1, âList of Standard DHCPv6 Optionsâ</a> for the names. In certain cases
      it could also work for custom options, but due to the nature of the parser
      code this may be unreliable and should be avoided.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dhcp6-client-classifier"></a>8.2.18.Â Client Classification in DHCPv6</h3></div></div></div><p>
      The DHCPv6 server includes support for client classification.  For a deeper
      discussion of the classification process see <a class="xref" href="#classify" title="ChapterÂ 12.Â Client Classification">ChapterÂ 12, <i>Client Classification</i></a>.
      </p><p>
      In certain cases it is useful to differentiate between different types
      of clients and treat them accordingly. It is envisaged that client
      classification will be used for changing the behavior of almost any part of
      the DHCP message processing, including the assignment of leases from different
      pools, the assignment of different options (or different values of the same
      options) etc. In the current release of the software however, there are
      only two mechanisms that take advantage of client classification:
      subnet selection and assignment of different options.
      </p><p>
      Kea can be instructed to limit access to given subnets based on class information.
      This is particularly useful for cases where two types of devices share the
      same link and are expected to be served from two different subnets. The
      primary use case for such a scenario is cable networks. Here, there are two
      classes of devices: the cable modem itself, which should be handed a lease
      from subnet A and all other devices behind the modem that should get a lease
      from subnet B. That segregation is essential to prevent overly curious
      users from playing with their cable modems. For details on how to set up
      class restrictions on subnets, see <a class="xref" href="#classification-subnets" title="12.6.Â Configuring Subnets With Class Information">SectionÂ 12.6, âConfiguring Subnets With Class Informationâ</a>.
      </p><p>
      The process of doing classification is conducted in three steps. The first step
      is to assess an incoming packet and assign it to zero or more classes.  The
      second step is to choose a subnet, possibly based on the class information.
      The third step is to assign options again possibly based on the class
      information.
      </p><p>
      There are two methods of doing classification. The first is automatic and relies
      on examining the values in the vendor class options. Information from these
      options is extracted and a class name is constructed from it and added to
      the class list for the packet. The second allows you to specify an expression
      that is evaluated for each packet. If the result is true the packet is
      a member of the class.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        Care should be taken with client classification as it is easy for
        clients that do not meet class criteria to be denied any service altogether.

        The following example shows how to configure a class using an expression
        and a subnet making use of that class. This configuration defines the
        class named "Client_enterprise". It is comprised
        of all clients whose client identifiers start with the given hex string (which
        would indicate a DUID based on an enterprise id of 0xAABBCCDD).
        They will be given an address from 2001:db8:1::0 to 2001:db8:1::FFFF and
        the addresses of their DNS servers set to 2001:db8:0::1 and 2001:db8:2::1.

      the DHCP-DDNS server (referred to here as "D2") to update

      In order for NCRs to reach the D2 server, kea-dhcp6 must be able
      to communicate with it.  kea-dhcp6 uses the following configuration
      parameters to control this communication:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

      delivered.  If the number of requests queued for transmission reaches
      this value, DDNS updating will be turned off until the queue backlog has
      been sufficiently reduced.  The intent is to allow kea-dhcp6 to
      continue lease operations.  The default value is 1024.
      </li><li class="listitem">

      By default, kea-dhcp-ddns is assumed to running on the same machine as kea-dhcp6, and
      all of the default values mentioned above should be sufficient.
      If, however, D2 has been configured to listen on a different address or
      port, these values must altered accordingly. For example, if D2 has been
      configured to listen on 2001:db8::5 port 900, the following configuration
      would be required:

      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4704" target="_top">RFC 4704</a>.
      It is important to keep in mind that kea-dhcp6 provides the initial
      decision making of when and what to update and forwards that
      information to D2 in the form of NCRs. Carrying out the actual
      DNS updates and dealing with such things as conflict resolution
      are within the purview of D2 itself (<a class="xref" href="#dhcp-ddns-server" title="ChapterÂ 10.Â The DHCP-DDNS Server">ChapterÂ 10, <i>The DHCP-DDNS Server</i></a>).
      This section describes when kea-dhcp6 will generate NCRs and the
      configuration parameters that can be used to influence this decision.
      It assumes that the <span class="command"><strong>enable-updates</strong></span> parameter is true.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        Currently the interface between kea-dhcp6 and D2 only supports requests
        which update DNS entries for a single IP address.  If a lease grants
        more than one address, kea-dhcp6 will create the DDNS update request for
        only the first of these addresses.  Support for multiple address
        mappings may be provided in a future release.
        </p></div><p>
      In general, kea-dhcp6 will generate DDNS update requests when:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
      A new lease is granted in response to a REQUEST
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      An existing lease is renewed but the FQDN associated with it has
      changed.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      An existing lease is released in response to a RELEASE
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      In the second case, lease renewal, two  DDNS requests will be issued: one
      request to remove entries for the previous FQDN and a second request to
      add entries for the new FQDN.  In the last case, a lease release, a
      single DDNS request to remove its entries will be made.
      </p><p>
      The decision making involved when granting a new lease the first case) is more
      involved. When a new lease is granted, kea-dhcp6 will generate a DDNS
      update request only if the REQUEST contains the FQDN option (code 39).
      By default kea-dhcp6 will respect the FQDN N and S flags specified by the client
      as shown in the following table:
      </p><div class="table"><a name="dhcp6-fqdn-flag-table"></a><p class="title"><b>TableÂ 8.3.Â Default FQDN Flag Behavior</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Default FQDN Flag Behavior" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left" class="cflags"><col align="left" class="meaning"><col align="left" class="response"><col align="left" class="sflags"></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Client Flags:N-S</th><th align="left">Client Intent</th><th align="left">Server Response</th><th align="left">Server Flags:N-S-O</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">0-0</td><td align="left">

      The first row in the table above represents "client delegation". Here
      the DHCP client states that it intends to do the forward DNS updates and
      the server should do the reverse updates.  By default, kea-dhcp6 will honor
      the client's wishes and generate a DDNS request to D2 to update only
      reverse DNS data.  The parameter, <span class="command"><strong>override-client-update</strong></span>, can be used
      to instruct the server to override client delegation requests.  When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp6 will disregard requests for client
      delegation and generate a DDNS request to update both forward and
      reverse DNS data.  In this case, the N-S-O flags in the server's
      response to the client will be 0-1-1 respectively.
      </p><p>
      (Note that the flag combination N=1, S=1 is prohibited according to
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4702" target="_top">RFC 4702</a>. If such a
      combination is received from the client, the packet will be dropped by kea-dhcp6.)
      </p><p>
      To override client delegation, set the following values in the configuration:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"override-client-update": true</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The third row in the table above describes the case in which the client
      requests that no DNS updates be done. The parameter, <span class="command"><strong>override-no-update</strong></span>,
      can be used to instruct the server to disregard the client's wishes. When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp6 will generate DDNS update requests to
      kea-dhcp-ddns even if the client requests no updates be done.  The N-S-O
      flags in the server's response to the client will be 0-1-1.
      </p><p>
      To override client delegation, issue the following commands:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {

        If the DHCPREQUEST contains the client FQDN option, the candidate name

      </p></li></ol></div><p>
        These rules can amended by setting the

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        <span class="command"><strong>never</strong></span> - Use the name the client sent.  If the client

    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
    Note that formerly, this parameter was a boolean and permitted only values
    of <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span>.  Boolean values
    will still be accepted but may eventually be deprecated. A value of
    <span class="command"><strong>true</strong></span> equates to <span class="command"><strong>when-present</strong></span>,
    <span class="command"><strong>false</strong></span> equates to <span class="command"><strong>never</strong></span>.
    </div><p>

      For example, To instruct kea-dhcp6 to always generate the FQDN for a
      client, set the parameter <span class="command"><strong>replace-client-name</strong></span> to
      <span class="command"><strong>always</strong></span> as follows:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"replace-client-name": "always"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The prefix used in the generation of an FQDN is specified by the
      <span class="command"><strong>generated-prefix</strong></span> parameter.  The default value is "myhost".  To alter
      its value, simply set it to the desired string:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"generated-prefix": "another.host"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The suffix used when generating an FQDN or when qualifying a
      partial name is specified by
      the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> parameter. This
      parameter has no default value, thus it is mandatory when
      DDNS updates are enabled.
      To set its value simply set it to the desired string:
      </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <strong class="userinput"><code>"qualifying-suffix": "foo.example.org"</code></strong>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</pre></div><p>
      When qualifying a partial name, kea-dhcp6 will construct a name with the
      format:
      </p><p>
        [candidate-name].[qualifying-suffix].
      </p><p>
      where candidate-name is the partial name supplied in the REQUEST.
      For example, if FQDN domain name value was "some-computer" and
      qualifying-suffix "example.com", the generated FQDN would be:
      </p><p>
        some-computer.example.com.
      </p><p>
      When generating the entire name, kea-dhcp6 will construct name of the
      format:
      </p><p>
        [generated-prefix]-[address-text].[qualifying-suffix].
      </p><p>
      where address-text is simply the lease IP address converted to a
      hyphenated string.  For example, if lease address is 3001:1::70E,
      the qualifying suffix "example.com", and the default value is used for
      <span class="command"><strong>generated-prefix</strong></span>, the generated FQDN would be:

    a per host basis. The most obvious one is to reserve specific, static IPv6
    address or/and prefix for exclusive use by a given client (host) â returning
    client will get the same address or/and prefix every time and other clients will
    never get that address. Note that there may be cases when the
    new reservation has been made for the client for the address or prefix being
    currently in use by another client. We call this situation a "conflict". The
    conflicts get resolved automatically over time as described in the subsequent
    sections. Once conflict is resolved, the client will keep receiving the reserved
    configuration when it renews.</p><p>Another example when the host reservations are applicable is when a host
    has specific requirements, e.g. a printer that needs additional DHCP options
    or a cable modem needs specific parameters. Yet another possible use case for
    host reservation is to define unique names for hosts.</p><p>Hosts reservations are defined as parameters for each subnet. Each host
    can be identified by either DUID or its hardware/MAC address. See
    <a class="xref" href="#mac-in-dhcpv6" title="8.9.Â MAC/Hardware Addresses in DHCPv6">SectionÂ 8.9, âMAC/Hardware Addresses in DHCPv6â</a> for details. There is an optional
    <span class="command"><strong>reservations</strong></span> array in the
    <span class="command"><strong>subnet6</strong></span> structure. Each element in that array
    is a structure, that holds information about a single host. In
    particular, the structure has an identifier that
    uniquely identifies a host.  In the DHCPv6 context, such an identifier
    is usually a DUID, but can also be a hardware or MAC address.  Also,
    either one or more addresses or prefixes may be specified. It is
    possible to specify a hostname and DHCPv6 options for a given host.</p><p>The following example shows how to reserve addresses and prefixes

    are reserved for a client using DUID 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0A. The
    last reservation also assigns a hostname to this client.
    </p><p>Note that DHCPv6 allows for a single client to lease multiple addresses
    and multiple prefixes at the same time. Therefore <span class="command"><strong>ip-addresses</strong></span>
    and <span class="command"><strong>prefixes</strong></span> are plural and are actually arrays.
    When the client sends multiple IA options (IA_NA or IA_PD), each reserved
    address or prefix is assigned to an individual IA of the appropriate type. If
    the number of IAs of specific type is lower than the number of reservations
    of that type, the number of reserved addresses or prefixes assigned to the
    client is equal to the number of IA_NAs or IA_PDs sent by the client, i.e.
    some reserved addresses or prefixes are not assigned. However,
    they still remain reserved for this client and the server will not assign
    them to any other client. If the number of IAs of specific type sent by the
    client is greater than the number of reserved addresses or prefixes, the
    server will try to assign all reserved addresses or prefixes to the individual
    IAs and dynamically allocate addresses or prefixes to remaining IAs. If the
    server cannot assign a reserved address or prefix because it is in use,
    the server will select the next reserved address or prefix and try to assign it to
    the client. If the server subsequently finds that there are no more reservations
    that can be assigned to the client at the moment, the server will try to
    assign leases dynamically.
    </p><p>Making a reservation for a mobile host that may visit multiple subnets
    requires a separate host definition in each subnet it is expected to visit.
    It is not allowed to define multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address in a single subnet. Multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address are valid if each is in a different subnet.  The reservation for a given host
    should include only one identifier, either DUID or hardware address. Defining
    both for the same host is considered a configuration error, but as of 1.1.0,
    it is not rejected.
    </p><p>Adding host reservation incurs a performance penalty. In principle,
    when a server that does not support host reservation responds to a query,
    it needs to check whether there is a lease for a given address being
    considered for allocation or renewal. The server that also supports host
    reservation, has to perform additional checks: not only if the address is
    currently used (i.e. if there is a lease for it), but also whether the address
    could be used by someone else (i.e. if there is a reservation for it). That
    additional check incurs additional overhead.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation6-types"></a>8.3.1.Â Address/Prefix Reservation Types</h3></div></div></div><p>In a typical scenario there is an IPv6 subnet defined with a certain
      part of it dedicated for dynamic address allocation by the DHCPv6
      server. There may be an additional address space defined for prefix
      delegation. Those dynamic parts are referred to as dynamic pools, address
      and prefix pools or simply pools. In principle, the host reservation can
      reserve any address or prefix that belongs to the subnet. The reservations
      that specify an address that belongs to configured pools are called
      "in-pool reservations". In contrast, those that do not
      belong to dynamic pools are called "out-of-pool
      reservations". There is no formal difference in the reservation
      syntax and both reservation types are handled
      uniformly. However, upcoming releases may offer improved performance if
      there are only out-of-pool reservations as the server will be able to skip
      reservation checks when dealing with existing leases. Therefore, system
      administrators are encouraged to use out-of-pool reservations if
      possible.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation6-conflict"></a>8.3.2.Â Conflicts in DHCPv6 Reservations</h3></div></div></div><p>As reservations and lease information are stored separately,
      conflicts may arise. Consider the following series of events. The server
      has configured the dynamic pool of addresses from the range of 2001:db8::10
      to 2001:db8::20. Host A requests an address and gets 2001:db8::10. Now the
      system administrator decides to reserve address 2001:db8::10 for Host B.
      In general, reserving an address
      that is currently assigned to someone else is not recommended, but there
      are valid use cases where such an operation is warranted.</p><p>The server now has a conflict to resolve. Let's analyze the
      situation here. If Host B boots up and request an address, the server is
      not able to assign the reserved address 2001:db8::10. A naive approach
      would to be immediately remove the lease for Host A and create a new one
      for Host B. That would not solve the problem, though, because as soon as
      Host B get the address, it will detect that the address is already in use
      by someone else (Host A) and would send a Decline message. Therefore in this
      situation, the server has to temporarily assign a different address from the
      dynamic pool (not matching what has been reserved) to Host B.</p><p>When Host A renews its address, the server will discover that
      the address being renewed is now reserved for someone else (Host
      B). Therefore the server will remove the lease for 2001:db8::10, select
      a new address and create a new lease for it. It will send two
      addresses in its response: the old address with lifetime set to 0 to
      explicitly indicate that it is no longer valid and the new address with a
      non-zero lifetime. When Host B renews its temporarily assigned
      address, the server will detect that the existing lease does not match
      reservation, so it will release the current address Host B has and will
      create a new lease matching the reservation. Similar as before, the server
      will send two addresses: the temporarily assigned one with zeroed
      lifetimes, and the new one that matches reservation with proper lifetimes
      set.</p><p>This recovery will succeed, even if other hosts will attempt to get
      the reserved address. Had Host C requested address 2001:db8::10 after
      the reservation was made, the server will propose a different address.</p><p>This recovery mechanism allows the server to fully recover from a
      case where reservations conflict with existing leases. This procedure
      takes time and will roughly take as long as renew-timer value specified.
      The best way to avoid such recovery is to not define new reservations that
      conflict with existing leases. Another recommendation is to use
      out-of-pool reservations. If the reserved address does not belong to a
      pool, there is no way that other clients could get this address.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reservation6-hostname"></a>8.3.3.Â Reserving a Hostname</h3></div></div></div><p>When the reservation for the client includes the <span class="command"><strong>hostname</strong></span>,
      the server will assign this hostname to the client and send
      it back in the Client FQDN, if the client sent the FQDN option to the
      server. The reserved hostname always takes precedence over the hostname
       supplied by the client (via the FQDN option) or the autogenerated
      (from the IPv6 address) hostname.</p><p>The server qualifies the reserved hostname with the value
      of the <span class="command"><strong>qualifying-suffix</strong></span> parameter. For example, the
      following subnet configuration:

      in this case the value specified as a <span class="command"><strong>hostname</strong></span> will

      allocation engine (the component of Kea that selects an address for a client)
      during lease selection and renewal. In particular, three
      major checks are necessary. First, when selecting a new lease, it is not
      sufficient for a candidate lease to not be used by another DHCP client. It
      also must not be reserved for another client. Second, when renewing a lease,
      additional check must be performed whether the address being renewed is not
      reserved for another client. Finally, when a host renews an address or a
      prefix, the server has to check whether there is a reservation for this host,
      so the existing (dynamically allocated) address should be revoked and the
      reserved one be used instead.</p><p>Some of those checks may be unnecessary in certain deployments and not
      performing them may improve performance. The Kea server provides the
      <span class="command"><strong>reservation-mode</strong></span> configuration parameter to select the
      types of reservations allowed for the particular subnet. Each reservation
      type has different constraints for the checks to be performed by the
      server when allocating or renewing a lease for the client.
      Allowed values are:

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"> <span class="command"><strong>all</strong></span> - enables all host reservation
      types. This is the default value. This setting is the safest and the most
      flexible. It allows in-pool and out-of-pool reservations. As all checks
      are conducted, it is also the slowest.
      </li><li class="listitem"> <span class="command"><strong>out-of-pool</strong></span> - allows only out of
      pool host reservations.  With this setting in place, the server may assume
      that all host reservations are for addresses that do not belong to the
      dynamic pool. Therefore it can skip the reservation checks when dealing
      with in-pool addresses, thus improving performance. Do not use this mode
      if any of your reservations use in-pool address. Caution is advised when
      using this setting. Kea 1.1.0 does not sanity check the reservations against
      <span class="command"><strong>reservation-mode</strong></span> and misconfiguration may cause problems.
      </li><li class="listitem">
      <span class="command"><strong>disabled</strong></span> - host reservation support is disabled. As there
      are no reservations, the server will skip all checks. Any reservations defined
      will be completely ignored. As the checks are skipped, the server may
      operate faster in this mode.
      </li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
        An example configuration that disables reservation looks like follows:
        </p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "subnet6": [
        {
        "subnet": "2001:db8:1::/64",

        ...
        }
    ]
}
</pre><p>
      </p><p>Another aspect of the host reservations are different types of
      identifiers. Kea 1.1.0 supports two types of identifiers
      in DHCPv6: hw-address and duid, but more identifier types
      are likely to be added in the future. This is beneficial from a
      usability perspective. However, there is a drawback. For each incoming
      packet Kea has to to extract each identifier type and then query the
      database to see if there is a reservation done by this particular
      identifier. If nothing is found, the next identifier is extracted and next
      query is issued. This process continues until either a reservation is
      found or all identifier types have been checked. Over time with an increasing
      number of supported identifier types, Kea would become slower and
      slower.</p><p>To address this problem, a parameter called
      <span class="command"><strong>host-reservation-identifiers</strong></span> has been introduced. It
      takes a list of identifier types as a parameter. Kea will check only those
      identifier types enumerated in host-reservation-identifiers. From a
      performance perspective the number of identifier types should be kept to
      minimum, ideally limited to one. If your deployment uses several
      reservation types, please enumerate them from most to least frequently
      used as this increases the chances of Kea finding the reservation using the
      fewest number of queries. An example of host reservation identifiers looks
      as follows:

      as a DUID) for clients to be able to discriminate between several
      servers present on the same link.
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315" target="_top">RFC 3315</a>

      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6355" target="_top">RFC 6355</a>
      also defines DUID-UUID. Future specifications may introduce new
      DUID types.</p><p>The Kea DHCPv6 server generates a server identifier once, upon
      the first startup, and stores it in a file. This identifier isn't
      modified across restarts of the server and so is a stable identifier.</p><p>Kea follows recommendation from
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315" target="_top">RFC 3315</a>
      to use DUID-LLT as the default server identifier. However, we have
      received reports that some deployments require different DUID
      types, and there is a need to administratively select both DUID
      type and/or its contents.</p><p>The server identifier can be configured using parameters
      within the <span class="command"><strong>server-id</strong></span> map element in the global
      scope of the Kea configuration file. The following example
      demonstrates how to select DUID-EN as a server identifier:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "server-id": {
        "type": "EN"

      parameter are: "LLT", "EN" and "LL", for DUID-LLT, DUID-EN and
      DUID-LL respectively.</p><p>When a new DUID type is selected the server will generate its
      value and replace any existing DUID in the file. The server will then
      use the new server identifier in all future interactions with the
      clients.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If the new server identifier is created after some clients
      have obtained their leases, the clients using the old identifier will not
      be able to renew the leases: the server will ignore messages
      containing the old server identifier. Clients will continue sending
      Renew until they transition to the rebinding state. In this state they
      will start sending Rebind messages to multicast address without
      a server identifier. The server will respond to the Rebind messages
      with a new server identifier and the clients will associate the
      new server identifier with their leases. Although the clients will
      be able to keep their leases and will eventually learn the new server
      identifier, this will be at the cost of increased number of renewals
      and multicast traffic due to a need to rebind. Therefore it is
      recommended that modification of the server identifier type
      and value is avoided if the server has already assigned leases and these
      leases are still valid.</p></div><p>There are cases when an administrator needs to explicitly

      Similarly, if the "identifier" is assigned an empty string, the

      If the server is not using any DUID yet, it will use link layer
      address and hardware type from one of the available network
      interfaces. The server will use an explicit value of time. If it

      </p><p>As in the case of the DUID-LLT, special values can be used for the
      configuration of the DUID-EN. If <span class="command"><strong>enterprise-id</strong></span> is 0, the server
      will use a value from the existing DUID-EN. If the server is not using
      any DUID or the existing DUID has a different type, the ISC enterprise

These
      assignments (leases) have state that changes over time, hence
      their name, stateful. DHCPv6 also supports a stateless mode,
      where clients request configuration options only. This mode is
      considered lightweight from the server perspective as it does not require
      any state tracking; hence its name.</p><p>The Kea server supports stateless mode. Clients can send
      Information-Request messages and the server will send back
      answers with the requested options (providing the options are
      available in the server configuration).  The server will attempt to
      use per-subnet options first. If that fails - for whatever reason - it
      will then try to provide options defined in the global scope.</p><p>Stateless and stateful mode can be used together. No special
      configuration directives are required to handle this. Simply use the
      configuration for stateful clients and the stateless clients will get
      just options they requested.</p><p>This usage of global options allows for an interesting case.
      It is possible to run a server that provides just options and no
      addresses or prefixes. If the options have the same value in each
      subnet, the configuration can define required options in the global
      scope and skip subnet definitions altogether. Here's a simple example of
      such a configuration:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ "ethX" ]

    } ]</code></strong>,
    "lease-database": { "type": "memfile" }
 }
</pre><p>
      This very simple configuration will provide DNS server information
      to all clients in the network, regardless of their location. Note the
      specification of the memfile lease database: this is needed as
      Kea requires a lease database to be specified
      even if it is not used.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dhcp6-rfc7550"></a>8.6.Â Support for RFC 7550</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7550" target="_top">RFC 7550</a>
      introduced some changes to the DHCPv6 protocol to resolve a few issues
      with the coexistence of multiple stateful options in the messages sent
      between the clients and servers.</p><p>The typical example is when the client, such as a requesting
      router, requests an allocation of both addresses and prefixes when
      it performs the 4-way (SARR) exchange with the server. If the
      server is not configured to allocate any prefixes but it can allocate
      some addresses, it will respond with the IA_NA(s) containing allocated
      addresses and the IA_PD(s) containing the NoPrefixAvail status code. If
      the client can operate without prefixes it may transition to the
      'bound' state when it sends Renew/Rebind messages to the server,
      according to the T1 and T2 times, to extend the lifetimes of the
      allocated addresses. If the client is still interested in obtaining
      prefixes from the server it may also include an IA_PD in the Renew/Rebind
      to request allocation of the prefixes. If the server still cannot
      allocate the prefixes, it will respond with the IA_PD(s) containing
      NoPrefixAvail status code. However, if the server can now allocate
      the prefixes it will do so, and send them in the IA_PD(s) to the client.
      Allocation of leases during the Renew/Rebind was not supported in the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315" target="_top">RFC 3315</a>
      and <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3633" target="_top">RFC 3633</a>,
      and has been introduced in
      <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7550" target="_top">RFC 7550</a>.
      Kea supports this new behavior and it doesn't provide any configuration
      mechanisms to disable it.

        The following are the other behaviors specified in the

        The relay has to have an interface connected to the link on which
        the clients are being configured. Typically the relay has a global IPv6
        address configured on the interface that belongs to the subnet from which
        the server will assign addresses. In the typical case, the
        server is able to use the IPv6 address inserted by the relay (in the link-addr
        field in RELAY-FORW message) to select the appropriate subnet.
      </p><p>
        However, that is not always the case. The relay
        address may not match the subnet in certain deployments. This
        usually means that there is more than one subnet allocated for a given
        link. The two most common examples where this is the case are long lasting
        network renumbering (where both old and new address space is still being
        used) and a cable network. In a cable network both cable modems and the
        devices behind them are physically connected to the same link, yet
        they use distinct addressing. In such case, the DHCPv6 server needs
        additional information (like the value of interface-id option or IPv6
        address inserted in the link-addr field in RELAY-FORW message) to
        properly select an appropriate subnet.
      </p><p>
        The following example assumes that there is a subnet 2001:db8:1::/64
        that is accessible via a relay that uses 3000::1 as its IPv6 address.
        The server will be able to select this subnet for any incoming packets
        that came from a relay with an address in 2001:db8:1::/64 subnet.
        It will also select that subnet for a relay with address 3000::1.

          In certain cases, it is useful to mix relay address information,

          One specific example is a cable network, where typically modems
          get addresses from a different subnet than all devices connected
          behind them.
        </p><p>
          Let's assume that there is one CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System)
          with one CM MAC (a physical link that modems are connected to).
          We want the modems to get addresses from the 3000::/64 subnet,
          while everything connected behind modems should get addresses from
          another subnet (2001:db8:1::/64). The CMTS that acts as a relay

      from the clients and administrators
      frequently use that information to perform certain tasks, like per host
      configuration, address reservation for specific MAC addresses and other.
      Unfortunately, the DHCPv6 protocol does not provide any completely reliable way
      to retrieve that information. To mitigate that issue a number of mechanisms
      have been implemented in Kea that attempt to gather it. Each
      of those mechanisms works in certain cases, but may fail in other cases.
      Whether the mechanism works or not in the particular deployment is
      somewhat dependent on the network topology and the technologies used.</p><p>Kea allows configuration of which of the supported methods should be
      used and in what order. This configuration may be considered a fine tuning
      of the DHCP deployment. In a typical deployment the default
      value of <span class="command"><strong>"any"</strong></span> is sufficient and there is no
      need to select specific methods. Changing the value of this parameter
      is the most useful in cases when an administrator wants to disable
      certain method, e.g. if the administrator trusts the network infrastructure
      more than the information provided by the clients themselves, the
      administrator may prefer information provided by the relays over that
      provided by the clients.
      </p><p>
      The configuration is controlled by the <span class="command"><strong>mac-sources</strong></span>parameter as follows:

    When not specified, a special value of "any" is used, which

    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>any</strong></span> - Not an actual method, just a keyword that

        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>raw</strong></span> - In principle, a DHCPv6 server could use raw

        no effect.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>duid</strong></span> - DHCPv6 uses DUID identifiers instead of

        Although <a class="ulink" href="" target="_top">RFC 3315</a> forbids
        it, it is possible to parse those DUIDs and extract
        necessary information from them. This method is not completely reliable, as
        clients may use other DUID types, namely DUID-EN or DUID-UUID.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="command"><strong>ipv6-link-local</strong></span> - Another possible acquisition

        method is not completely reliable, as clients may use other link-local address
        types.  In particular, privacy extensions, defined in
        <a class="ulink" href="" target="_top">RFC 4941</a>, do not use
        MAC addresses.  Also note that successful extraction requires that the

      jurisdiction over those addresses. However, due to various
      reasons, such as misconfiguration or a faulty client implementation
      that retains its address beyond the valid lifetime, there may be
      devices connected that use those addresses without the server's
      approval or knowledge.</p><p>Such an unwelcome event can be detected
      by legitimate clients (using Duplicate Address Detection) and
      reported to the DHCPv6 server using a DECLINE message. The server
      will do a sanity check (if the client declining an address really
      was supposed to use it), then will conduct a clean up operation
      and confirm it by sending back a REPLY message. Any DNS entries
      related to that address will be removed, the fact will be logged
      and hooks will be triggered. After that is done, the address
      will be marked as declined (which indicates that it is used by
      an unknown entity and thus not available for assignment to
      anyone) and a probation time will be set on it. Unless otherwise
      configured, the probation period lasts 24 hours. After that
      period, the server will recover the lease (i.e. put it back into
      the available state) and the address will be available for assignment
      again. It should be noted that if the underlying issue of a
      misconfigured device is not resolved, the duplicate address
      scenario will repeat. On the other hand, it provides an
      opportunity to recover from such an event automatically, without
      any sysadmin intervention.</p><p>To configure the decline probation period to a value other
      than the default, the following syntax can be used:
</p><pre class="screen">
  "Dhcp6": {
    <strong class="userinput"><code>"decline-probation-period": 3600</code></strong>,
    "subnet6": [ ... ],
    ...
}
</pre><p>
      The parameter is expressed in seconds, so the example above will instruct
      the server to recycle declined leases after an hour.</p><p>There are several statistics and hook points associated with the
      Decline handling procedure. The lease6_decline hook is triggered after the
      incoming Decline message has been sanitized and the server is about to decline
      the lease. The declined-addresses statistic is increased after the
      hook returns (both global and subnet specific variants). (See
      <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-stats" title="7.7.Â Statistics in the DHCPv4 Server">SectionÂ 7.7, âStatistics in the DHCPv4 Serverâ</a> and <a class="xref" href="#hooks-libraries" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Hooks Libraries">ChapterÂ 13, <i>Hooks Libraries</i></a> for more details
      on DHCPv4 statistics and Kea hook points.)</p><p>Once the probation time elapses, the declined lease is recovered
      using the standard expired lease reclamation procedure, with several
      additional steps. In particular, both declined-addresses statistics
      (global and subnet specific) are decreased. At the same time,
      reclaimed-declined-addresses statistics (again in two variants, global and
      subnet specific) are increased.</p><p>Note about statistics: The server does not decrease the
      assigned-addresses statistics when a DECLINE message is received and
      processed successfully. While technically a declined address is no longer
      assigned, the primary usage of the assigned-addresses statistic is to
      monitor pool utilization. Most people would forget to include
      declined-addresses in the calculation, and simply do
      assigned-addresses/total-addresses. This would have a bias towards
      under-representing pool utilization. As this has a potential for major
      issues, we decided not to decrease assigned addresses immediately after
      receiving Decline, but to do it later when we recover the address back to
      the available pool.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dhcp6-stats"></a>8.11.Â Statistics in the DHCPv6 Server</h2></div></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This section describes DHCPv6-specific statistics.

                One likely cause would be a misbehaving relay agent that incorrectly

  delegate prefixes to DHCP clients. These addresses and prefixes are
  often referred to as "leases". Leases are typically assigned to clients
  for a finite amount of time, known as the "valid lifetime". DHCP clients who
  wish to continue using their assigned leases, will periodically renew them
  by sending the appropriate message to the DHCP server. The DHCP server records
  the time when these leases are renewed and calculates new expiration times
  for them.
  </p><p>If the client does not renew a lease before its valid lifetime
  elapses, the lease is considered expired. There are many situations
  when the client may cease lease renewals.  A common scenario is when
  the machine running the client shuts down for an extended period of
  time.</p><p> The process through which the DHCP server makes expired leases
  available for reassignment is referred to as "lease reclamation" and expired
  leases returned to availability through this process are referred to as
  "reclaimed".
  The DHCP server attempts to reclaim an expired lease as soon as it detects
  that it has expired. One way in which the server detects expiration occurs
  when it is trying to allocate a lease to a client and finds this
  lease already present in the database but expired.  Another way
  is by periodically querying the lease
  database for them.  Regardless of how an expired lease is detected, before
  it may assigned to a client, it must be reclaimed.
  </p><p>
  This chapter explains how to configure the server to periodically query
  for the expired leases and how to minimize the impact of the periodic lease
  reclamation process on the server's responsiveness. Finally, it explains
  "lease affinity", which provides the means to assign the same lease to a
  returning client after its lease has expired.
  </p><p>Although, all configuration examples in this section are provided
  for the DHCPv4 server, the same parameters may be used for the
  DHCPv6 server configuration.

    leases. During this process the lease entries in the database are
    modified or removed. While this is happening the server will not process incoming DHCP
    messages to avoid issues with concurrent access to database information.
    As a result, the server will be unresponsive while lease reclamation
    is performed and DHCP queries will accumulate; responses will be
    sent once the leases reclamation cycle is complete.</p><p>In deployments where response time is critical, administrators may
    wish to minimize the interruptions in service caused by lease reclamation.
    Toward this end, Kea provides configuration parameters to control: the
    frequency of lease reclamation cycles, the maximum number of leases
    processed in a single reclamation cycle, and the maximum amount of time a
    single reclamation cycle is allowed to run before being interrupted. The
    following examples demonstrate how these parameters can be used:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    ...

    "expired-leases-processing": {
        "reclaim-timer-wait-time": 5,
        "max-reclaim-leases": 0,
        "max-reclaim-time": 0,
        "flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time": 0,
    },

    ...
}
</pre><p>
    </p><p>The first parameter is expressed in seconds and specifies an
    interval between the two consecutive lease reclamation cycles. This
    is explained by the following diagram.

</p><pre class="screen">

|  c1  |            | c2 |            |c3|            | c4 |
|&lt;----&gt;|&lt;----------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;----------&gt;|&lt;&gt;|&lt;----------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|
----------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
|      |     5s     |    |     5s     |  |     5s     |    | time

</pre><p>

    </p><p>This diagram shows four lease reclamation cycles (c1 through c4) of variable duration.
    Note that the duration of the reclamation cycle depends on the number
    of expired leases detected and processed in the particular cycle. This
    duration is also usually significantly shorter than the interval between
    the cycles.
    </p><p>According to the <span class="command"><strong>reclaim-timer-wait-time</strong></span> the
    server keeps fixed intervals of five seconds between the end of one cycle
    and the start of the next cycle. This guarantees the presence of
    5s long periods during which the server remains responsive to DHCP
    queries and does not perform lease reclamation. The
    <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-leases</strong></span> and
    <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-time</strong></span> are set to 0, which sets
    no restriction on the maximum number of leases reclaimed
    in the particular cycle, or on the maximum duration of each cycle.
    </p><p>In deployments with high lease pool utilization, relatively
    short valid lifetimes, and frequently disconnecting clients which
    allow leases to expire, the number of expired leases requiring reclamation
    at any given time may rise significantly. In this case it is often
    desirable to apply restrictions on the maximum duration of a reclamation
    cycle or the maximum number of leases reclaimed in a cycle. The following
    configuration demonstrates how this can be done:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    ...

    "expired-leases-processing": {
        "reclaim-timer-wait-time": 3,
        "max-reclaim-leases": 100,
        "max-reclaim-time": 50,
        "unwarned-reclaim-cycles": 10,
    },

    ...
}

</pre><p>

    </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-leases</strong></span> parameter limits the number
    of leases reclaimed in a single cycle to 100. The
    <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-time</strong></span> limits the maximum duration of each
    cycle to 50ms. The lease reclamation cycle will be interrupted if either
    of these limitations is reached. The reclamation of all unreclaimed
    leases will be attempted in subsequent cycles.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the behavior of the system in the
    presence of many expired leases, when the limits are applied for the
    reclamation cycles.

</p><pre class="screen">

| c1 |                | c2 |                | c3 |                | c4 |
|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--------------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--------------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--------------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--
------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
|50ms|       3s       |50ms|       3s       |50ms|       3s       |50ms|  time

</pre><p>

    </p><p>The diagram demonstrates the case when each reclamation cycle would take
    more than 50ms, and thus is interrupted according to the value of the
    <span class="command"><strong>max-reclaim-time</strong></span>. This results in equal durations of
    all reclamation cycles over time. Note that in this example the limitation
    of maximum 100 leases is not reached. This may be the case when database
    transactions are slow or callouts in the hook libraries attached to
    the server are slow.  Regardless, the choosing values for either the
    maximum number of leases or a maximum cycle time strongly depends on the
    particular deployment, lease database backend being used, and any hooks
    libraries etc.  Administrators may need to experiment to tune the system
    to suit the dynamics of their deployment.</p><p>It is important to realize that with the use of these limits, there
    is a risk that expired leases will accumulate faster than the server can
    reclaim them.  This should not be the problem if the server is dealing
    with a temporary burst of expirations, because it should be able to
    eventually deal with them over time. However, if leases expire at a high
    rate for a longer period of time, the unreclaimed leases will pile up in
    the database. In order to notify the administrator that the current
    configuration does not satisfy the needs for reclamation of expired
    leases, the server issues a warning message in the log if it was unable
    to reclaim all leases within the last couple of reclamation cycles. The
    number of cycles after which such warning is issued is specified with the
    <span class="command"><strong>unwarned-reclaim-cycles</strong></span> configuration parameter.
    </p><p>Setting the <span class="command"><strong>reclaim-timer-wait-time</strong></span> to 0 disables
    periodic reclamation of the expired leases.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="lease-affinity"></a>9.3.Â Configuring Lease Affinity</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose that a laptop goes to a sleep mode after a period of user
    inactivity.  While the laptop is in sleep mode, its DHCP client will not
    renew leases obtained from the server and these leases will eventually
    expire.  When the laptop wakes up, it is often desirable for it to continue
    using its previous assigned IP addresses. In order to facilitate this,
    the server needs to correlate returning clients with their expired leases
    When the client returns, the server will first check for those leases and
    re-assign them if they have not been assigned to another client.  The ability
    of the server to re-assign the same lease to a returning client is
    referred to as "lease affinity".
    </p><p>When lease affinity is enabled, the server will still
    reclaim leases according to the parameters described in
    <a class="xref" href="#lease-reclaim-config" title="9.2.Â Configuring Lease Reclamation">SectionÂ 9.2, âConfiguring Lease Reclamationâ</a>, but the reclaimed leases
    will be held in the database (rather than removed) for the specified
    amount of time. When the client returns, the server will first check
    if there are any reclaimed leases associated with this client and
    re-assign them if possible. However, it is important to note that
    any reclaimed lease may be assigned to another client if that client
    specifically asks for it. Therefore, the lease affinity does not
    guarantee that the reclaimed lease will be available for the client
    who used it before; it merely increases the chances for the client to
    be assigned the same lease. If the lease pool is small (this mostly applies
    to DHCPv4 for which address space is small), there is an increased
    likelihood that the expired lease will be assigned to another client.
    </p><p>Consider the following configuration:

</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": {
    ...

    "expired-leases-processing": {
        "reclaim-timer-wait-time": 3,
        "hold-reclaimed-time": 1800,
        "flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time": 5
    },

    ...
}
</pre><p>

    </p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>hold-reclaim-time</strong></span> specifies how many seconds
    after an expiration a reclaimed lease should be held in the database
    for re-assignment to the same client. In the example given above,
    reclaimed leases will be held for 30 minutes (1800s) after their
    expiration. During this time, the server will likely be able to
    re-assign the same lease to the returning client, unless another client
    requests this lease and the server assigns it.</p><p>The server must periodically remove reclaimed leases for which the
    time indicated by <span class="command"><strong>hold-reclaim-time</strong></span> has elapsed. The
    <span class="command"><strong>flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time</strong></span> controls how
    often the server removes such leases. In the example provided
    above, the server will initiate removal of such leases 5 seconds after
    the previous removal attempt was completed. Setting this value to 0
    disables lease affinity, in which case leases will be removed from the
    lease database when they are reclaimed.  If lease affinity is enabled, it
    is recommended that <span class="command"><strong>hold-reclaim-time</strong></span> be set to a value significantly
    higher than the <span class="command"><strong>reclaim-timer-wait-time</strong></span>, as timely
    removal of expired-reclaimed leases is less critical while the removal
    process may impact server responsiveness.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="lease-reclamation-defaults"></a>9.4.Â Default Configuration Values for Leases Reclamation</h2></div></div></div><p>The following list presents all configuration parameters

    The DHCP-DDNS Server (kea-dhcp-ddns, known informally as D2) conducts the client side of
    the DDNS protocol (defined in <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136" target="_top">RFC 2136</a>)
    on behalf of the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
    servers (kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 respectively). The DHCP servers construct
    DDNS update requests, known as NameChangeRequests (NCRs), based upon DHCP
    lease change events and then post these to D2. D2 attempts to match
    each such request to the appropriate DNS server(s) and carry out the
    necessary conversation with those servers to update the DNS data.
    </p><p>
    In order to match a request to the appropriate DNS servers, D2 must have a
    catalog of servers from which to select. In fact, D2 has two such catalogs,
    one for forward DNS and one for reverse DNS; these catalogs are referred
    to as DDNS Domain Lists.  Each list consists of one or more named DDNS
    Domains. Further, each DDNS Domain has a list of one or more DNS
    servers that publish the DNS data for that domain.
    </p><p>
    When conducting forward domain matching, D2 will compare the FQDN in
    the request against the name of each forward DDNS Domain. The domain
    whose name matches the longest portion of the FQDN is considered the
    best match.  For example, if the FQDN is "myhost.sample.example.com.",
    and there are two forward domains in the catalog: "sample.example.com."
    and "example.com.", the former is regarded as the best match.  In some
    cases, it may not be possible to find a suitable match. Given the same two
    forward domains there would be no match for the FQDN, "bogus.net", so the
    request would be rejected.   Finally, if there are no forward DDNS Domains
    defined, D2 will simply disregard the forward update portion of requests.
    </p><p>
    When conducting reverse domain matching, D2 constructs a reverse
    FQDN from the lease address in the request and compare that against
    the name of each reverse DDNS Domain. Again, the domain whose name matches
    the longest portion of the FQDN is considered the best match. For instance,
    if the lease address is "172.16.1.40" and there are two reverse domains in
    the catalog: "1.16.172.in-addr.arpa." and "16.172.in-addr.arpa", the
    former is the best match.  As with forward matching, it is possible to not
    find a suitable match.  Given the same two domains, there would be no
    match for the lease address, "192.168.1.50", and the request would be
    rejected. Finally, if there are no reverse DDNS Domains defined, D2 will
    simply disregard the reverse update portion of requests.

	A DDNS protocol exchange can be conducted with or without TSIG
	(defined in <a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf/org/html/rfc2845" target="_top">RFC
	2845</a>). This configuration section allows the administrator
	to define the set of TSIG keys that may be used in such
	exchanges.</p><p>To use TSIG when updating entries in a DNS Domain,
	a key must be defined in the TSIG Key List and referenced by
	name in that domain's configuration entry.  When D2 matches a
	change request to a domain, it checks whether the domain has
	a TSIG key associated with it.  If so, D2 will use that key to
	sign DNS update messages sent to and verify responses received
	from the domain's DNS server(s). For each TSIG key required by
	the DNS servers that D2 will be working with there must be a
	corresponding TSIG key in the TSIG Key list.</p><p>
	As one might gather from the name, the tsig-key section of the
	D2 configuration lists the TSIG keys.  Each entry describes a
	TSIG key used by one or more DNS servers to authenticate requests
	and sign responses.  Every entry in the list has three parameters:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

	      used when updating a specific domain. So long as it is unique its
	      content is arbitrary, although for clarity and ease of maintenance
	      it is recommended that it match the name used on the DNS server(s).

	      The default value 0 means truncation is forbidden, non-zero
	      values must be an integral number of octets, be greater

      In certain cases it is useful to differentiate between different
      types of clients and treat them accordingly. Common reasons include:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
      The clients represent different pieces of topology, e.g. a cable
      modem is different to the clients behind that modem.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      The clients have different behavior, e.g. a smart phone behaves
      differently to a laptop.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      The clients require different values for some options, e.g. a docsis3.0
      cable modem requires different settings to docsis2.0 cable modem.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
      It is envisaged that client classification will be used for changing the
      behavior of almost any part of the DHCP message processing, including the assignment of
      leases from different pools, the assignment of different options (or different values of
      the same options) etc. In the current release of the software however, there are
      only three mechanisms that take
      advantage of client classification: subnet selection, assignment of different
      options and, for DHCPv4 cable modems, the setting of specific options for use with
      the TFTP server address and the boot file field.
      </p><p>
      The process of doing classification is conducted in three steps:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
      Assess an incoming packet and assign it to zero or more classes.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Choose a subnet, possibly based on the class information.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Assign options, again possibly based on the class information.
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p><p>
      When determining which options to include in the response the server will examine
      the union of options from all of the assigned classes. In the case two or more
      classes include the same option, the value from the first class examined will
      be used.  When choosing a subnet, the server will iterate over all of the
      subnets that are feasible given the information found in the packet (client address,
      relay address etc). It will use the first subnet it finds that either doesn't
      have a class associated with it or that has a class which matches one of
      the packet's classes. In the future the processing order of the
      various classes may be specified but for now it is being left unspecified and
      may change in future releases.
      </p><p>
      As an example, imagine that an incoming packet matches two classes.
      Class "foo" defines values for an NTP server
      (option 42 in DHCPv4) and an SMTP server (option 69 in DHCPv4) while class
      "bar" defines values for an NTP server and a POP3 server (option 70 in DHCPv4).
      The server will examine the three options NTP, SMTP and POP3 and return any
      of them that the client requested.  As the NTP server was defined twice the
      server will choose only one of the values for the reply: the class from which the
      value is obtained is unspecified.
      </p><p>
      There are two methods of doing classification. The first is automatic and relies
      on examining the values in the vendor class options. Information from these
      options is extracted and a class name is constructed from it and added to
      the class list for the packet. The second allows you to specify an expression
      that is evaluated for each packet. If the result is true, the packet is
      a member of the class.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
        Care should be taken with client classification as it is easy for
        clients that do not meet class criteria to be denied any service altogether.

    in <a class="xref" href="#reservation4-client-classes" title="7.3.6.Â Reserving Client Classes in DHCPv4">SectionÂ 7.3.6, âReserving Client Classes in DHCPv4â</a> and

      The server checks whether an incoming DHCPv4 packet includes
      the vendor class identifier option (60) or an incoming DHCPv6 packet
      includes the vendor class option (16). If it does, the content of that
      option is prepended with "VENDOR_CLASS_" and the result is interpreted
      as a class. For example, modern cable modems will send this option with
      value "docsis3.0" and so the packet will belong to
      class "VENDOR_CLASS_docsis3.0".
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="classification-using-expressions"></a>12.4.Â Using Expressions In Classification</h2></div></div></div><p>
      The expression portion of classification contains operators and values.
      All values are currently strings and operators take a string or strings and
      return another string. When all the operations have completed
      the result should be a value of "true" or "false".
      The packet belongs to
      the class (and the class name is added to the list of classes) if the result
      is "true". Expressions are written in standard format and can be nested.
      </p><p>
      Expressions are pre-processed during the parsing of the configuration file
      and converted to an internal representation. This allows certain types of
      errors to be caught and logged during parsing.  Examples of these errors
      include an incorrect number or types of arguments to an operator.  The
      evaluation code will also check for this class of error and generally
      throw an exception, though this should not occur in a normally functioning
      system.
      </p><p>
      Other issues, for example the starting position of a substring being
      outside of the substring or an option not existing in the packet, result
      in the operator returning an empty string.
      </p><p>
      Expressions are a work in progress and the supported operators and
      values are limited. The expectation is that additional operators and values
      will be added over time, however the basic mechanisms will
      remain the same.

      Integers in an expression are converted to 32 bit unsigned integers and

      unsigned integers, even if the field in the packet is smaller.  In general
      it is easier to use decimal notation to represent integers, but it is also
      possible to use hex notation. When using hex notation to represent an
      integer care should be taken to make sure the value is represented as 32
      bits, e.g. use 0x00000001 instead of 0x1 or 0x01. Also, make

        The Not, And and Or logical operators are the common operators. Not
        has the highest precedence and Or the lowest. And and Or are (left)
        associative, parentheses around a logical expression can be used
        to enforce a specific grouping, for instance in "A and (B or C)"
        (without parentheses "A and B or C" means "(A and B) or C").
      </div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp57130352"></a>12.4.2.Â Substring</h3></div></div></div>
        The substring operator "substring(value, start, length)" accepts both positive and
        negative values for the starting position and the length.  For "start", a value of
        0 is the first byte in the string while -1 is the last byte.  If the starting
        point is outside of the original string an empty string is returned.  "length"
        is the number of bytes to extract.  A negative number means to count towards
        the beginning of the string but doesn't include the byte pointed to by "start".
        The special value "all" means to return all bytes from start to the end of the
        string.  If length is longer than the remaining portion of the string then
        the entire remaining portion is returned.  Some examples may be helpful:

          <pre class="screen">
        substring('foobar', 0, 6) == 'foobar'
        substring('foobar', 3, 3) == 'bar'
        substring('foobar', 3, all) == 'bar'
        substring('foobar', 1, 4) == 'ooba'
        substring('foobar', -5, 4) == 'ooba'
        substring('foobar', -1, -3) == 'oba'
        substring('foobar', 4, -2) == 'ob'
        substring('foobar', 10, 2) == ''
          </pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp57133088"></a>12.4.3.Â Concat</h3></div></div></div>
        The concat function "concat(string1, string2)" returns the
        concatenation of its two arguments. For instance:
          <pre class="screen">
        concat('foo', 'bar') == 'foobar'
          </pre></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
    The expression for each class is executed on each packet received.
    If the expressions are overly complex, the time taken to execute
    them may impact the performance of the server. If you need
    complex or time consuming expressions you should write a <a class="link" href="#hooks-libraries" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Hooks Libraries">hook</a> to perform the necessary work.

      A class contains three items: a name, a test expression and option data.
      The name must exist and must be unique amongst all classes. The test
      expression and option data are optional.
      </p><p>
      The test expression is a string containing the logical expression used to
      determine membership in the class.  The entire expression is in double
      quotes.
      </p><p>
      The option data is a list which defines any options that should be assigned

      Currently classes can be used for two functions.  They can supply options
      to the members of the class and they can be used to choose a subnet from which an
      address will be assigned to the class member.
      </p><p>
      When supplying options, options defined as part of the class definition
      are considered "class globals".  They will override any global options that
      may be defined and in turn will be overridden by any options defined for an
      individual subnet.

      You may use a hook to classify your packets. This may be useful if the
      expression would either be complex or time consuming and be easier or
      better to write as code.  Once the hook has added the proper class name

     While you are constructing your classification expressions you may
     find it useful to enable logging see <a class="xref" href="#logging" title="ChapterÂ 17.Â Logging">ChapterÂ 17, <i>Logging</i></a> for
     a more complete description of the logging facility.
     </p><p>
     To enable the debug statements in the classifciaton system you will
     need to set the severity to "DEBUG" and the debug level to at least 55.
     The specific loggers are "kea-dhcp4.eval" and "kea-dhcp6.eval".
     </p><p>
     In order to understand the logging statements one must understand a
     bit about how expressions are evaluated, for a more complete description
     refer to the design document at <a class="ulink" href="http://kea.isc.org/wiki/KeaDesigns" target="_top">http://kea.isc.org/wiki/KeaDesigns</a>.
     In brief there are two structures used during the evaluation of an expression:
     a list of tokens which represent the expressions and a value stack which
     represents the values being manipulated.
     </p><p>
     The list of tokens is created when the configuration file is processed with
     most expressions and values being converted to a token.  The list is organized
     in reverse Polish notation.  During execution, the list will be traversed
     in order.  As each token is executed it will be able to pop values
     from the top of the stack and eventually push its result on the top of the
     stack.  Imagine the following expression:
       </p><pre class="screen">
       "test": "substring(option[61].hex,0,3) == 'foo'",
       </pre><p>
     This will result in the following tokens:
       </p><pre class="screen">
       option, number (0), number (3), substring, text ('foo'), equals
       </pre><p>
     In this example the first three tokens will simply push values onto the
     stack.  The substring token will then remove those three values and
     compute a result that it places on the stack.  The text option also
     places a value on the stack and finally the equals token removes the
     two tokens on the stack and places its result on the stack.
     </p><p>
     When debug logging is enabled, each time a token is evaluated it will
     emit a log message indicating the values of any objects that were popped
     off of the value stack and any objects that were pushed onto the value
     stack.
     </p><p>
     The values will be displayed as either text if the command is known
     to use text values or hexadecimal if the command either uses binary values or
     can manipulate either text or binary values.  For expressions that
     pop multiple values off the stack, the values will be displayed in
     the order they were popped.  For most expressions this won't matter
     but for the concat expression the values are displayed in reverse
     order from how they are written in the expression.
     </p><p>
     Let us assume that the following test has been entered into the configuration.
     This example skips most of the configuration to concentrate on the test.
       </p><pre class="screen">
       "test": "substring(option[61].hex,0,3) == 'foo'",
       </pre><p>
     The logging might then resemble this:
       </p><pre class="screen">
       2016-05-19 13:35:04.163 DEBUG [kea.eval/44478] EVAL_DEBUG_OPTION Pushing option 61 with value 0x666F6F626172

     The debug logging may be quite verbose if you have a number of expressions
     to evaluate.  It is intended as an aid in helping you create and debug
     your expressions.  You should plan to disable debug logging when you have your
     expressions working correctly.  You also may wish to include only one set of
     expressions at a time in the configuration file while debugging them in order
     to limit the log statements.  For example when adding a new set of expressions
     you might find it more convenient to create a configuration file that only
     includes the new expressions until you have them working correctly and then
     add the new set to the main configuration file.

      Although Kea offers a lot of flexibility, there may be cases where
      its behavior needs customisation.  To accommodate this possibility,
      Kea includes the idea of "Hooks".  This feature lets Kea load one
      or more dynamically-linked libraries (known as "hooks libraries")
      and, at various points in its processing ("hook points"), call
      functions in them.  Those functions perform whatever custom
      processing is required.
      </p><p>
      Hooks libraries are attached to individual Kea processes, not to
      Kea as a whole.  This means (for example) that it is possible
      to associate one set of libraries with the DHCP4 server and a
      different set to the DHCP6 server.
      </p><p>
      Another point to note is that it is possible for a process to
      load multiple libraries.  When processing reaches a hook point,
      Kea calls the hooks library functions attached to it.  If multiple
      libraries have attached a function to a given hook point, Kea calls
      all of them, in the order in which the libraries are specified in
      the configuration file. The order may be important: consult the
      documentation of the libraries to see if this is the case.
      </p><p>
      The next section describes how to configure hooks libraries. If you
      are interested in writing your own hooks library, information can be
      found in the <a class="ulink" href="https://jenkins.isc.org/job/Fedora20_32_doxygen_doc/doxygen/" target="_top">Kea
      Developer's Guide</a>.

      The hooks libraries for a given process are configured using the
      <span class="command"><strong>hooks-libraries</strong></span> keyword in the
      configuration for that process. (Note that
      the word "hooks" is plural).  The value of the keyword
      is an array of map structures, each structure corresponding to a hooks
      library.  For example, to set up two hooks libraries for the DHCPv4
      server, the configuration would be:
</p><pre class="screen">
<strong class="userinput"><code>"Dhcp4": {
    :
    "hooks-libraries": [
        {

        This is a change to the syntax used in Kea 0.9.2 and earlier, where
        hooks-libraries was a list of strings, each string being the name of
        a library.  The change was made in Kea 1.0 to facilitate the
        specification of library-specific parameters, a capability
        available in Kea 1.1.0 onwards.
      </p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
          The library reloading behavior has changed in Kea 1.1. Libraries are
          reloaded, even if their list hasn't changed. Kea does that, because
          the parameters specified for the library (or the files those
          parameters point to) may have changed.
          </p></div><p>
        Libraries may have additional parameters. Those are not mandatory in the
        sense that there may be libraries that don't require them. However, for
        specific library there is often specific requirement for specify certain
        set of parameters. Please consult the documentation for your library
        for details. In the example above, the first library has no parameters.
        The second library has five parameters, specifying mail (string
        parameter), floor (integer parameter), debug (boolean parameter) and
        even lists (list of strings) and maps (containing strings). Nested
        parameters could be used if the library supports it. This topic is
        explained in detail in the Hooks Developer's Guide in the "Configuring
        Hooks Libraries" section.

          There is one case where this is not true: if Kea

          removed and the configuration reloaded, the removal will be

      As described above, the hooks functionality provides a way to customize
      a Kea server without modifying the core code.  ISC has chosen to take
      advantage of this feature to provide functions that may only be useful
      to a subset of Kea users.  To this end ISC has created some hooks
      libraries; these discussed in the following sections.
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
      Some of these libraries will be available with the base code while others
      will be shared with organizations supporting development of Kea
      , possibly as a 'benefit' or 'thank you' for helping to sustain
      the larger Kea project. If you would like to get access to those
      libraries, please consider taking out a support contract: this includes
      professional support, advance security notifications, input into our
      roadmap planning, and many other benefits, while helping
      making Kea sustainable in the long term.

              is a new IPv6 transition
              technology that provides IPv4 as a service in IPv6-only
              network. It assumes that dual-stack clients will get a regular IPv6
              address and IPv6 prefix, but only a fraction of an IPv4 address. The
              fraction is specified as port-set, which is essentially a range of
              TCP and UDP ports a client can use. By doing the transition on the
              client side, this technology eliminates the need to deploy
              expensive Carrier Grade NATs within the operator's network. The
              problem on the DHCP side is the non-trivial logic behind it: each
              client needs to receive an unique set of lightweight 4over6 options
              (<a class="ulink" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7598" target="_top">RFC 7598</a>),
              that include the IPv4 address (shared among several
              clients), port-set (which is unique among clients sharing the same
              IPv4 address) and a number of additional parameters. This hooks
              library will generate values of those options dynamically, thus
              eliminating the need to manually configure values for each client
              separately.

        ISC hopes to see more hooks libraries become available as time
        progresses, both developed internally and externally. Since
        this list may evolve dynamically, we decided to keep it on a
        wiki page, available at this link: <a class="ulink" href="http://kea.isc.org/wiki/Hooks" target="_top">http://kea.isc.org/wiki/Hooks</a>.
        If you are a developer or are aware of any hooks libraries not

        mailing lists and someone will update it.

          The user_chk library is the first hooks library published by ISC. It
          attempts to serve several purposes:

          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>To assign "new" or "unregistered" users to a
              restricted subnet, while "known" or "registered" users are assigned
              to unrestricted subnets.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>To allow DHCP response options or vendor option
              values to be customized based upon user identity. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>To provide a real time record of the user registration
              activity which can be sampled by an external consumer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p> To serve as a demonstration of various capabilities
              possible using the hooks interface.</p></li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>
          Once loaded, the library allows segregating incomings requests into
          known and unknown clients. For known clients, the packets are
          processed mostly as usual, except it is possible to override certain
          options being sent. That can be done on a per host basis. Clients
          that are not on the known hosts list will be treated as unknown and
          will be assigned to the last subnet defined in the configuration file.
        </p><p>
          As an example of use, this behavior may be used to put unknown users into a
          separate subnet that leads to a walled garden, where they can only
          access a registration portal. Once they fill in necessary data, their
          details are added to the known clients file and they get a proper
          address after their device is restarted.
        </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>This library was developed several years before the host
        reservation mechanism has become available. Currently host reservation is
        much more
        powerful and flexible, but nevertheless the user_chk capability to consult
        and external source of information about clients and alter Kea's
        behavior is useful and remains of educational value.
        </p></div><p>
          The library reads the /tmp/user_chk_registry.txt file while being
          loaded and each time an incoming packet is processed. The file is expected
          to have each line contain a self-contained JSON snippet which must
          have the following two entries:

          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>type</strong></span>, whose value
            is "HW_ADDR" for IPv4 users or "DUID" for IPv6
            users</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>id</strong></span>, whose value is
            either the hardware address or the DUID from the equest
            formatted as a string of hex digits, with or without
            ":" delimiters.</p></li></ul></div><p>

and may have the zero or more of the following entries:

          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>bootfile</strong></span> whose value
            is the pathname of the desired file</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>tftp_server</strong></span> whose
            value is the hostname or IP address of the desired
            server</p></li></ul></div><p>

          A sample user registry file is shown below:

</p><pre class="screen">{ "type" : "HW_ADDR", "id" : "0c:0e:0a:01:ff:04", "bootfile" : "/tmp/v4bootfile" }

        This section describes the forensic log hooks library. This library
        povides hooks that record a detailed log of lease assignments
        and renewals into a set of log files.  Currently this library
        is only available to ISC customers with a support contract.
        </p><p>
        In many legal jurisdictions companies, especially ISPs, must record
        information about the addresses they have leased to DHCP clients.
        This library is designed to help with that requirement.  If the
        information that it records is sufficient it may be used directly.
        If your jurisdiction requires that you save a different set of
        information you may use it as a template or example and create your
        own custom logging hooks.
        </p><p>
        This logging is done as a set of hooks to allow it to be customized
        to any particular need.  Modifying a hooks library is easier and
        safer than updating the core code.  In addition by using the hooks
        features those users who don't need to log this information can
        leave it out and avoid any performance penalties.

          To use this functionality the hook library must be included in the
          configuration of the desired DHCP server modules. The legal_log
          library is installed alongside the Kea libraries in
          <code class="filename">[kea-install-dir]/lib</code> where
          <code class="filename">kea-install-dir</code> is determined by the
          "--prefix" option of the configure script.  It defaults to
          <code class="filename">/usr/local</code>.  Assuming the
          default value then, configuring kea-dhcp4 to load the legal_log
          library could be done with the following Kea4 configuration:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp4": { <strong class="userinput"><code>
    "hooks-libraries": [

            }
        },
        ...
    ] </code></strong>
}
</pre><p>
          </p><p>
          To configure it for kea-dhcp6, the commands are simply as shown below:
</p><pre class="screen">
"Dhcp6": { <strong class="userinput"><code>
    "hooks-libraries": [

    A working DHCP server encounters various events
    that can cause certain statistics to be collected. For
    example, a DHCPv4 server may receive a packet (pkt4-received
    statistic increases by one) that after parsing was identified as a
    DHCPDISCOVER (pkt4-discover-received). The Server processed it and
    decided to send a DHCPOFFER representing its answer (pkt4-offer-sent
    and pkt4-sent statistics increase by one). Such events happen
    frequently, so it is not uncommon for the statistics to have
    values in high thousands. They can serve as an easy and powerful
    tool for observing a server's and network's health. For example,
    if pkt4-received statistic stops growing, it means that the
    clients' packets are not reaching the server.</p><p>There are four types of statistics:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>integer</em></span> - this is the most common type.  It
        is implemented as 64 bit integer (int64_t in C++), so it can hold any
        value between -2^63 to 2^63 -1.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>floating point</em></span> - this type is intended to
        store floating point precision. It is implemented as double C++ type.
        </li><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>duration</em></span> - this type is intended for
        recording time periods. It uses boost::posix_time::time_duration type,
        which stores hours, minutes, seconds and microseconds.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="emphasis"><em>string</em></span> - this type is intended for
        recording statistics in textual form. It uses std::string C++ type.
        </li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      During normal operation, DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers gather statistics.
      For a list of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 statistics, see <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-stats" title="7.7.Â Statistics in the DHCPv4 Server">SectionÂ 7.7, âStatistics in the DHCPv4 Serverâ</a> and <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-stats" title="8.11.Â Statistics in the DHCPv6 Server">SectionÂ 8.11, âStatistics in the DHCPv6 Serverâ</a>, respectively.
    </p><p>
      To extract data from the statistics module, the control channel can be
      used. See <a class="xref" href="#ctrl-channel" title="ChapterÂ 15.Â Management API">ChapterÂ 15, <i>Management API</i></a> for details. It is possible to
      retrieve a single or all statistics, reset statistics (i.e. set to neutral
      value, typically zero) or even remove completely a single or all
      statistics. See section <a class="xref" href="#command-stats" title="14.3.Â Commands for Manipulating Statistics">SectionÂ 14.3, âCommands for Manipulating Statisticsâ</a> for a list of
      statistic oriented commands.

      It is useful to understand how the Statistics Manager module works. When
      the server starts operation, the manager is empty and does not have any
      statistics. When <span class="command"><strong>statistic-get-all</strong></span> is executed, an
      empty list is returned. Once the server performs an operation that causes
      a statistic to change, the related statistic will be created. In the general
      case, once a statistic is recorded even once, it is kept in the manager, until
      explicitly removed, by <span class="command"><strong>statistic-remove</strong></span> or
       <span class="command"><strong>statistic-remove-all</strong></span> being called or the server is shut
      down. Per subnet statistics are explicitly removed when reconfiguration
      takes place.
    </p><p>
      Statistics are considered run-time properties, so they are not retained
      after server restart.
    </p><p>
      Removing a statistic that is updated frequently makes little sense as it
      will be re-added when the server code next records that statistic.
      The <span class="command"><strong>statistic-remove</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>statistic-remove-all</strong></span> commands are intended to remove
      statistics that are not expected to be observed in the near future. For
      example, a misconfigured device in a network may cause clients to report
      duplicate addresses, so the server will report increasing values of
      pkt4-decline-received. Once the problem is found and the device is
      removed, the system administrator may want to remove the
      pkt4-decline-received statistic, so it won't be reported anymore. If a
      duplicate address is detected ever again, the server will add this
      statistic back.
    </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="command-stats"></a>14.3.Â Commands for Manipulating Statistics</h2></div></div></div><p>
      There are several commands defined that can be used for accessing (-get),
      resetting to zero or neutral value (-reset) or even removing a statistic
      completely (-remove). The difference between reset and remove is somewhat
      subtle.  The reset command sets the value of the statistic to zero or neutral
      value. After this operation, the statistic will have a value of 0 (integer),
      0.0 (float), 0h0m0s0us (duration) or "" (string). When asked for, a statistic
      with the values mentioned will be returned. <span class="command"><strong>Remove</strong></span> removes
      a statistic completely, so the statistic will not be reported anymore. Please
      note that the server code may add it back if there's a reason to record
      it.

    the server's configuration is stored in configuration files
    and, when the configuration is changed, the daemon is restarted.
    This approach has the significant disadvantage of introducing periods
    of downtime, when client traffic is not handled. Another risk
    is that if the new configuration is invalid for whatever reason,
    the server may refuse to start, which will further extend the
    downtime period until the issue is resolved.</p><p>To avoid such problems, both the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers
    include support for a mechanism that allows
    on-line reconfiguration without requiring server shutdown.
    Both servers can be instructed to open control sockets, which
    is a communication channel. The server is able to receive
    commands on that channel, act on them and report back status.
    While the set of commands in Kea 1.1.0 is limited,
    the number is expected to grow over time.</p><p>Currently the only supported type of control channel
    is UNIX stream socket. For details how to configure it, see
    <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-ctrl-channel" title="7.8.Â Management API for the DHCPv4 Server">SectionÂ 7.8, âManagement API for the DHCPv4 Serverâ</a> and <a class="xref" href="#dhcp6-ctrl-channel" title="8.12.Â Management API for the DHCPv6 Server">SectionÂ 8.12, âManagement API for the DHCPv6 Serverâ</a>. It is likely that support
    for other control channel types will be added in the future.

    structures. If configured, Kea will open a socket and listen
    for incoming connections. A process connecting to this socket
    is expected to send JSON commands structured as follows:

</p><pre class="screen">

    "command": "foo",
    "arguments": {
	"param1": "value1",
	"param2": "value2",
	...
    }
}
</pre><p>

    <span class="command"><strong>command</strong></span> is the name of command to execute and
    is mandatory. <span class="command"><strong>arguments</strong></span> is a map of parameters
    required to carry out the given command.  The exact content and
    format of the map is command specific.</p><p>The server will process the incoming command and then send a
    response of the form:
</p><pre class="screen">
{
    "result": 0|1,
    "text": "textual description",
    "arguments": {
	"argument1": "value1",
	"argument2": "value2",
	...
    }
}
</pre><p>
    <span class="command"><strong>result</strong></span> indicates the outcome of the command. A value of 0
    means success while any non-zero value designates an error. Currently 1 is
    used as a generic error, but additional error codes may be added in the
    future. The <span class="command"><strong>text</strong></span> field typically appears when result is
    non-zero and contains a description of the error encountered, but it may
    also appear for successful results (that is command specific).
    <span class="command"><strong>arguments</strong></span> is a map of additional data values returned by
    the server which is specific to the command issued. The map is always present, even
    if it contains no data values.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ctrl-channel-client"></a>15.2.Â Using the Control Channel</h2></div></div></div><p>Kea does not currently provide a client for using the control channel.  The primary
    reason for this is the expectation is that the entity using the control channel
    is typically an IPAM or similar network management/monitoring software which
    may have quite varied expectations regarding the client and is even likely to
    be written in languages different than C or C++. Therefore only examples are provided to show
    how one can take advantage of the API.</p><p>The easiest way is to use a tool called <span class="command"><strong>socat</strong></span>,
    a tool available from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/" target="_top">socat
    homepage</a>, but it is also widely available in Linux and BSD
    distributions. Once Kea is started, one could connect to the control
    interface using the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ socat UNIX:/path/to/the/kea/socket -
</pre><p>
where <span class="command"><strong>/path/to/the/kea/socket</strong></span> is the path specified in the
<span class="command"><strong>Dhcp4/control-socket/socket-name</strong></span> parameter in the Kea
configuration file. Text passed to <span class="command"><strong>socat</strong></span>
will be sent to Kea and the responses received from Kea printed to standard output.</p><p>It is also easy to open UNIX socket programmatically. An example of
    such a simplistic client written in C is available in the Kea Developer's
    Guide, chapter Control Channel Overview, section Using Control Channel.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="commands-common"></a>15.3.Â Commands Supported by Both the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 Servers</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="command-leases-reclaim"></a>15.3.1.Â leases-reclaim</h3></div></div></div><p>

      During its operation Kea may produce many messages. They differ in
      severity (some are more important than others) and source (some are
      produced by specific components, e.g. hooks). It is useful to understand
      which log messages are needed and which are not, and configure your
      logging appropriately. For example, debug level messages can be safely
      ignored in a typical deployment. They are, however, very useful when
      debugging a problem.
    </p><p>
      The logging system in Kea is configured through the
      Logging section in your configuration
      file. All daemons (e.g. DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers) will use the
      configuration in the Logging section to see
      what should be logged and to where. This allows for sharing identical
      logging configuration between daemons.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp50350448"></a>17.1.1.Â Loggers</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Within Kea, a message is logged through an entity called a
        "logger". Different components log messages through different
        loggers, and each logger can be configured independently of
        one another. Some components, in particular the DHCP server
        processes, may use multiple loggers to log messages pertaining
        to different logical functions of the component. For example,
        the DHCPv4 server uses one logger for messages
        pertaining to packet reception and transmission, another
        logger for messages related to lease allocation and so on.
        Some of the libraries used by the Kea servers, e.g. libdhcpsrv,
        use their own loggers.
      </p><p>
        Users implementing hooks libraries (code attached to the server at
        runtime) are responsible for creating the loggers used by those
        libraries. Such loggers should have unique names, different
        from the logger names used by Kea. In this way the
        messages output by the hooks library can be distingued from
        messages issued by the core Kea code. Unique names also allow
        the loggers to be configured independently of loggers used
        by Kea.  Whenever it makes sense, a hook library can use multiple
        loggers to log messages pertaining to different logical parts
        of the library.
      </p><p>
        In the Logging section of a configuration file you can specify the
        configuration for zero or more loggers (including loggers used by the
        proprietary hooks libraries). If there are no loggers specified, the
        code will use default values: these cause Kea to log messages of INFO
        severity or greater to standard output. There is also a small
        time window after Kea has been started, but has not yet read its
        configuration. Logging in this short period can be controlled
        using environment variables. For details, see <a class="xref" href="#logging-during-startup" title="17.1.3.Â Logging During Kea Startup">SectionÂ 17.1.3, âLogging During Kea Startupâ</a>.
      </p><p>
        The three main elements of a logger configuration are:
        <span class="command"><strong>name</strong></span> (the component that is generating the messages),
        the <span class="command"><strong>severity</strong></span> (what to log), and the
        <span class="command"><strong>output_commands</strong></span> (where to log).  There is also a
        <span class="command"><strong>debuglevel</strong></span> element, which is only relevant if
        debug-level logging has been selected.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp54868832"></a>17.1.1.1.Â name (string)</h4></div></div></div><p>
          Each logger in the system has a name, the name being that of the
          component binary file using it to log messages. For instance, if you
          want to configure logging for the DHCPv4 server, you add an entry
          for a logger named <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4</span>â</span>. This configuration will
          then be used by the loggers in the DHCPv4 server, and all the
          libraries used by it (unless a library defines its own logger and
          there is specific logger configuration that applies to that logger).
        </p><p>
          When tracking down an issue with the server's operation, use of
          DEBUG logging is required to obtain the verbose output needed for
          problems diagnosis.  However, the high verbosity is likely to
          overwhelm the logging system in cases when the server
          is processing high volume traffic. To mitigate this problem, use
          can be made of the fact that Kea uses multiple loggers for different
          functional parts of the server and that each of these can be configured independently.
          If the user is reasonably confident that a problem originates
          in a specific function of the server, or that the problem is related
          to the specific type of operation, they may enable high verbosity
          only for the relevant logger, so limiting the debug messages
          to the required minimum.
        </p><p>
          The loggers are associated with a particular library or binary
          of Kea. However, each library or binary may (and usually does)
          include multiple loggers. For example, the DHCPv4 server binary
          contains separate loggers for: packet parsing, for dropped packets,
          for callouts etc.
        </p><p>
          The loggers form a hierarchy.  For each program in Kea, there is
          a "root" logger, named after the program (e.g. the root logger for
          kea-dhcp (the DHCPv4 server) is named kea-dhcp4.  All other loggers
          are children of this logger, and are named accordingly, e.g. the
          the allocation engine in the DHCPv4 server logs messages using
          a logger called kea-dhcp4.alloc-engine.
        </p><p>
          This relationship is important as each child logger derives its
          default configuration from its parent root logger.
          In the typical case, the root logger configuration
          is the only logging configuration specified in the configuration
          file and so applies to all loggers. If an entry is made for
          a given logger, any attributes specified override those of
          the root logger, whereas any not specified are inherited from it.
        </p><p>
          To illustrate this, suppose you are using the DHCPv4 server
          with the root logger <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4</span>â</span> logging at the
          INFO level. In order to enable DEBUG verbosity for the DHCPv4
          packet drops, you must create configuration entry for the
          logger called <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4.bad-packets</span>â</span> and specify
          severity DEBUG for this logger. All other configuration
          parameters may be omited for this logger if the logger should
          use the default values specified in the root logger's
          configuration.
        </p><p>
          If there are multiple logger specifications in the configuration
          that might match a particular logger, the specification with the
          more specific logger name takes precedence. For example, if there
          are entries for both <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4</span>â</span> and
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4.dhcpsrv</span>â</span>, the DHCPv4 server â and all
          libraries it uses that are not dhcpsrv â will log messages
          according to the configuration in the first entry
          (<span class="quote">â<span class="quote">kea-dhcp4</span>â</span>).
        </p><p>

          Note that user-defined hook libraries should not use any of those
          loggers but should define new loggers with names that correspond to
          the libraries using them. Suppose that the user created the library
          called <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">libpacket-capture</span>â</span> to dump packets received and
          transmitted by the server to the file. The appropriate name for the
          logger could be <span class="command"><strong>kea-dhcp4.packet-capture</strong></span>. (Note
          that the hook library implementor only specifies the second part of
          this name, i.e. <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">packet-capture</span>â</span>. The first part is a
          root logger name and is prepended by the Kea logging system.) It is
          also important to note that since this new logger is a child of a root
          logger, it inherits the configuration from the root logger, something
          that can be overridden by an entry in the configuration file.
        </p><p>
          The list of loggers above excludes any loggers implemented in hooks
          libraries. Please consult the documentation for the libraries for the
          names of the loggers they define.
        </p><p>
          Additional loggers may be defined in future versions of Kea. The
          easiest way to find out the logger name is to configure all logging to
          go to a single destination and look for specific logger names. See
          <a class="xref" href="#logging-message-format" title="17.1.2.Â Logging Message Format">SectionÂ 17.1.2, âLogging Message Formatâ</a> for details.

          This specifies the category of messages logged.  Each message is

          When the severity of a logger is set to one of these values, it will
          only log messages of that severity and above (e.g. setting the logging
          severity to INFO will log INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages).  The
          severity may also be set to NONE, in which case all messages from that

              Due to a limitation of the underlying logging library (log4cplus),
              rolling over the log files (from ".1" to ".2", etc) may show odd
              results: There can be multiple small files at the timing of roll
              over.  This can happen when multiple processes try to roll over
              the files simultaneously.  Version 1.1.0 of log4cplus solved this
              problem, so if this version or later of log4cplus is used to
              build Kea, it should not happen.  Even for older versions it is

        The logging configuration is specified in the configuration file.
        However, when Kea starts, the file is not read until some way into the
        initialization process.  Prior to that, the logging settings are set to
        default values, although it is possible to modify some aspects of the
        settings by means of environment variables. Note that in the absence of
        any logging configuration in the configuration file, the settings of
        (possibly modified) default configuration will persist while the program
        is running.
      </p><p>
        The following environment variables can be used to control the behavior

      </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">KEA_LOCKFILE_DIR</span></dt><dd><p>

              "none", which instructs Kea to not create lock file at all. This

      for an extended answer.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="q2-generic"></a>18.1.2.Â Feature X is not supported yet. When/if will it be available?</h3></div></div></div><p>Kea is developed by a small team of engineers. Our resources are
      limited, so we need to prioritize requests. The complexity of a new
      feature (how difficult it is to implement a feature and how likely it
      would break something that already works), amount of work required and
      expected popularity (i.e., how many users would actually benefit from it)
      are three leading factors. We sometimes also have contractual obligations.
      </p><p> Simply stating that you'd like feature X is useful. We try to
      implement features that are actively requested first, but the reality
      is that we have more requests than we can handle, so some of them must
      be postponed, at least in the near future. So is your request likely to
      be rejected? Not at all. You can do many things to greatly improve the
      chances of your request being fulfilled. First, it helps to explain why you
      need a feature. If your explanation is reasonable and there are likely
      other users that would benefit from it, the chances for Kea developers
      to put this task on a roadmap is better. Saying that you are willing
      to participate in tests (e.g., test engineering drops when they become
      available) is also helpful.</p><p>Another thing you can do to greatly improve the chances of a feature
      to appear is to actually develop it on your own and submit a patch.
      That's an avenue that people often forget about. Kea is open source
      software and we do accept patches. There are certain requirements, like
      code quality, comments, unit-tests, documentation, etc., but we have
      accepted a significant number of patches in the past, so it's doable.
      Accepted contributions range from minor documentation corrections to
      significant new features, like support for a new database type. Before
      considering writing and submitting a patch, make sure you read
      the Contributor's Guide in the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://git.kea.isc.org/~tester/kea/doxygen/" target="_top">Kea Developer's Guide</a>.
      </p><p>Kea is developed by ISC, which is a non-profit organization.
      You may consider signing a development contract with us. In the past
      we did implement certain features due to contractual obligations.
      With additional funds we are able to put extra engineering efforts
      into Kea development. We can reshuffle our schedule or add extra
      hands to the team if needed. Please keep in mind that Kea is
      open source software and its principle goal is to provide a good DHCP
      solution that can be used by everyone. In other words, we may
      refuse a contract that would tie the solution to specific proprietary
      technology or make it unusable for other users. Also, we strive to
      make Kea a reference implementation, so if your proposal significantly
      violates a RFC, we may have a problem with that. Nevertheless, please
      talk to us and we may be able to find a solution.</p><p>Finally, Kea has a <a class="ulink" href="http://kea.isc.org/roadmap" target="_top">public
      roadmap</a>, with releases happening several times each year. We tend
      to not modify plans for the current milestone, unless there are very good
      reasons to do so. Therefore "I'd like a feature X in 6 months" is much
      better received than "I'd like a feature X now".</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="faq-dhcp4"></a>18.2.Â Frequently Asked Questions about DHCPv4</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp50913280"></a>18.2.1.Â I set up a firewall, but the Kea server still receives the traffic. Why?</h3></div></div></div><p>Any DHCPv4 server must be able to receive from and send traffic to
      hosts that don't have an IPv4 address assigned yet. That is typically not
      possible with regular UDP sockets, therefore the Kea DHCPv4 server uses raw
      sockets by default. Raw sockets mean that the incoming packets are received
      as raw Ethernet frames, thus bypassing the whole kernel IP stack, including
      any firewalling rules your kernel may provide.</p><p>If you do not want the server to use raw sockets, it is possible to
      configure the Kea DHCPv4 server to use UDP sockets instead. See <span class="command"><strong>dhcp-socket-type</strong></span>
      described in <a class="xref" href="#dhcp4-interface-configuration" title="7.2.4.Â Interface Configuration">SectionÂ 7.2.4, âInterface Configurationâ</a>. However,
      using UDP sockets has certain limitations. In particular, they may not allow
      for sending responses directly to clients without IPv4 addresses assigned.
      That's ok, if all your traffic is coming through relay agents.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="faq-dhcp6"></a>18.3.Â Frequently Asked Questions about DHCPv6</h2></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp51402992"></a>18.3.1.Â Kea DHCPv6 doesn't seem to get incoming traffic. I checked with tcpdump (or other traffic
      capture software) that the incoming traffic is reaching the box. What's wrong?</h3></div></div></div><p>Please check whether your OS has any IPv6 filtering rules. Many
      operating systems are shipped with firewalls that discard incoming IPv6
      traffic by default. In particular, many Linux distributions do that. Please
      check the output of the following command:
  </p><pre class="screen">
# <strong class="userinput"><code>ip6tables -L -n</code></strong></pre><p>
      One common mistake in this area is to use <span class="command"><strong>iptables</strong></span> tool,
      which lists IPv4 firewall rules only.
