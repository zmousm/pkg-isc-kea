  <title>Kea Control Agent</title>

  <section id="agent-overview">
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>Kea Control Agent (CA) is a daemon, first included in Kea 1.2, which
    exposes a RESTful control interface for managing Kea servers. The daemon
    can receive control commands over HTTP and either forward these commands
    to the respective Kea servers or handle these commands on its own. The
    determination whether the command should be handled by the CA or forwarded
    is made by checking the value of the 'service' parameter which may be
    included in the command from the controlling client. The details of the
    supported commands as well as their structures are provided in
    <xref linkend="ctrl-channel"/>.</para>
    <para>Hook libraries can be attached to the CA to provide support for
    additional commands or custom behavior of existing commands. Such hook
    libraries must implement callouts for 'control_command_receive' hook point.
    Details about creating new hook libraries and supported hook points can be
    found in
    <ulink url="https://jenkins.isc.org/job/Kea_doc/doxygen/">Kea Developer's Guide</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The CA processes received commands according to the following algorithm:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>
            Pass command into any installed hooks (regardless of service value(s)).
            If the command is handled by a hook, return the response.
          </simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>
            If the service specifies one more or services, the CA will forward the
            command to specified services and return the accumulated responses.
          </simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>
            If service is not specified or is an empty list, the CA will handle
            the command if it supports it.
          </simpara>
        </listitem>

    <title>Configuration</title>
    <para>The following example demonstrates the basic CA configuration.</para>

    <warning>
      <simpara>
        In the Kea 1.2 release the Control Agent configuration can't be
        specified within the same configuration file as DHCPv4, DHCPv6 and D2
        configuration. The default configuration file for the CA is installed
        in the <filename>etc/kea/kea-ca.conf</filename>. In the Kea 1.2 final
        release the CA configuration will be merged into the default
        <filename>etc/kea/kea.conf.</filename>
      </simpara>
    </warning>

    <para>
      The <command>http-host</command> and <command>http-port</command>
      specify an IP address and port to which HTTP service will be bound.
      In case of the example configuration provided above, the RESTful
      service will be available under the URL of
      <command>http://10.20.30.40:8080/</command>. If these parameters
      are not specified, the default URL is http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    </para>

    <para>
      It has been mentioned in the <xref linkend="agent-overview"/> that
      CA can forward received commands to the specific Kea servers for
      processing. For example, <command>config-get</command> is sent to
      retrieve configuration of one of the Kea services. When CA receives
      this command, including a <command>service</command> parameter
      indicating that the client desires to retrieve configuration of
      the DHCPv4 server, the CA will forward this command to this server
      and then pass the received response back to the client. More about
      the <command>service</command> parameter and general structure of
      the commands can be found in <xref linkend="ctrl-channel"/>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The CA uses unix domain sockets to forward control commands and receive
      responses from other Kea services. The <command>dhcp4-server</command>,
      <command>dhcp6-server</command> and <command>d2-server</command> maps
      specify the files to which unix domain sockets are bound. In case
      of the configuration above, the CA will connect to the DHCPv4 server
      via <filename>/path/to/the/unix/socket-v4</filename> to forward the
      commands to it. Obviously, the DHCPv4 server must be configured to
      listen to connections via this same socket. In other words, the command
      socket configuration for the DHCPv4 server and CA (for this server)
      must match. Consult the <xref linkend="dhcp4-ctrl-channel"/> and the
      <xref linkend="dhcp6-ctrl-channel"/> to learn how the socket
      configuration is specified for the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 services.
    </para>

    <para>
      Hooks libraries can be attached to the Control Agent just like to
      DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers. It currently supports one hook point
      'control_command_receive' which makes it possible to delegate
      processing of some commands to the hooks library. The
      <command>hooks-libraries</command> list contains the list of hooks
      libraries that should be loaded by the CA, along with their configuration
      information specified with <command>parameters</command>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Please consult <xref linkend="logging"/> for the details how to
      configure logging. The CA's root logger's name is
      <command>kea-ctrl-agent</command> as given in the example above.
    </para>

  <section id="agent-secure-connection">
    <title>Secure Connections</title>
    <para>
      Control Agent doesn't natively support secure HTTP connections like
      SSL or TLS. In order to setup secure connection please use one
      of the available third party HTTP servers and configure it to run
      as a reverse proxy to the Control Agent.
    </para>

  <section id="agent-limitations">
    <title>Control Agent Limitations</title>
    <para>
      Control Agent is a new component, first released in Kea 1.2. In
      this release it comes with two notable limitations:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <simpara>
            CA configuration must be specified in a separate configuration file
            from the configurations of other components. The default confirguation
            file for CA is located in <filename>etc/kea/kea-ca.conf</filename>.
          </simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>
            keactrl hasn't been updated to manage the Control Agent (start, stop
            reload). As a result, the CA must be started directly as described in
            <xref linkend="agent-launch"/>
          </simpara>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="agent-launch">
    <title>Starting Control Agent</title>
    <para>
      The CA is started by running its binary and specifying the configuration file
      it should use. For example:
<screen>
$ ./kea-ctrl-agent -c /usr/local/etc/kea/kea-ca.conf
</screen>
    </para>
