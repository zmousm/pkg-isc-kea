.SH "NAME"
kea-lfc \- Lease File Cleanup process in Kea
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBkea\-lfc\fR\ 'u
\fBkea\-lfc\fR [\fB\-4|\-6\fR] [\fB\-c\ \fR\fB\fIconfig\-file\fR\fR] [\fB\-p\ \fR\fB\fIpid\-file\fR\fR] [\fB\-x\ \fR\fB\fIprevious\-file\fR\fR] [\fB\-i\ \fR\fB\fIcopy\-file\fR\fR] [\fB\-o\ \fR\fB\fIoutput\-file\fR\fR] [\fB\-f\ \fR\fB\fIfinish\-file\fR\fR] [\fB\-v\fR] [\fB\-V\fR] [\fB\-W\fR] [\fB\-d\fR] [\fB\-h\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
service process removes redundant information from the files used to provide persistent storage for the memfile data base backend\&. The service is written to run as a stand alone process\&. While it can be started externally, there is usually no need to do this\&. It will be run on a periodic basis by the Kea DHCP servers\&.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.PP
The arguments are as follows:
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Verbose mode sets the logging level to debug\&. This is primarily for development purposes in stand\-alone mode\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
version causes the version stamp to be printed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR
.RS 4
Version causes a longer form of the version stamp to be printed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-W\fR
.RS 4
Display the configuration report\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Help causes the usage string to be printed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-4 | \-6\fR
.RS 4
The protocol version of the lease files, must be one of 4 or 6\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR
.RS 4
Configuration file including the configuration for
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
process\&. It may also contain configuration entries for other Kea services\&. Currently
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
gets all of its arguments from the command line, in the future it will be extended to get some arguments from the config file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR
.RS 4
PID file \- When the
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
process starts it attempts to determine if another instance of the process is already running by examining the pid file\&. If one is already running the new process is terminated\&. If one isn\*(Aqt running it writes its pid into the pid file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x\fR
.RS 4
Previous or ex lease file \- When
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
starts this is the result of any previous run of
\fBkea\-lfc\fR\&. When
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
finishes it is the result of this run\&. If
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
is interrupted before completing, this file may not exist\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR
.RS 4
Input or copy of lease file \- Before the DHCP server invokes
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
it will move the current lease file here and then call
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
with this file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR
.RS 4
Output lease file \- The temporary file
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
should use to write the leases\&. Upon completion of writing this this file it will be moved to the finish file (see below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Finish or completion file \- Another temporary file
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
uses for bookkeeping\&. When
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
completes writing the output file it moves it to this file name\&. After
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
finishes deleting the other files (previous and input) it moves this file to previous lease file\&. By moving the files in this fashion the
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
and the DHCP server processes can determine the correct file to use even if one of the processes was interrupted before completing its task\&.
.RE
.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
.PP
Kea comes with an extensive Kea User\*(Aqs Guide documentation that covers all aspects of running the Kea software \- compilation, installation, configuration, configuration examples and many more\&. Kea also features a Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea can print with a brief description for each of them\&. Both documents are typically available in various formats (txt, html, pdf) with your Kea distribution\&. The on\-line version is available at http://kea\&.isc\&.org/docs/\&.
.PP
Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer\*(Aqs Guide\&. It\*(Aqs on\-line version is available at http://kea\&.isc\&.org\&. Please follow Developer\*(Aqs Guide link\&.
.PP
Kea project website is available at: http://kea\&.isc\&.org\&.
.SH "MAILING LISTS AND SUPPORT"
.PP
There are two mailing lists available for Kea project\&. kea\-users (kea\-users at lists\&.isc\&.org) is intended for Kea users, while kea\-dev (kea\-dev at lists\&.isc\&.org) is intended for Kea developers, prospective contributors and other advanced users\&. Both lists are available at http://lists\&.isc\&.org\&. The community provides best effort type of support on both of those lists\&.
.PP
ISC provides professional support for Kea services\&. See https://www\&.isc\&.org/kea/ for details\&.
.SH "HISTORY"
.PP
The
\fBkea\-lfc\fR
process was first coded in January 2015 by the ISC Kea/DHCP team\&.
