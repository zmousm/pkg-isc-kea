.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBperfdhcp\fR
is a DHCP benchmarking tool\&. It provides a way of measuring the performance of DHCP servers by generating large amounts of traffic from simulated multiple clients\&. It is able to test both IPv4 and IPv6 servers, and provides statistics concerning response times and the number of requests that are dropped\&.
.PP
By default, tests are run using the full four\-packet exchange sequence (DORA for DHCPv4, SARR for DHCPv6)\&. An option is provided to run tests using the initial two\-packet exchange (DO and SA) instead\&. It is also possible to configure perfdhcp to send DHCPv6 RENEW and RELEASE messages at a specified rate in parallel with the DHCPv6 four\-way exchanges\&.
.PP
When running a performance test,
\fBperfdhcp\fR
will exchange packets with the server under test as fast as possible unless the
\fB\-r\fR
is given to limit the request rate\&. The length of the test can be limited by setting a threshold on any or all of the number of requests made by
\fBperfdhcp\fR, the elapsed time, or the number of requests dropped by the server\&.
.SH "TEMPLATES"
.PP
To allow the contents of packets sent to the server to be customized,
\fBperfdhcp\fR
allows the specification of template files that determine the contents of the packets\&. For example, the customized packet may contain a DHCPv6 ORO to request a set of options to be returned by the server, or it may contain the Client FQDN option to request that server performs DNS updates\&. This may be used to discover performance bottlenecks for different server configurations (e\&.g\&. DDNS enabled or disabled)\&.
.PP
Up to two template files can be specified on the command line, each file representing the contents of a particular type of packet, the type being determined by the test being carried out\&. For example, if testing DHCPv6:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
With no template files specified on the command line,
\fBperfdhcp\fR
will generate both SOLICIT and REQUEST packets\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
With one template file specified, that file will be used as the pattern for SOLICIT packets:
\fBperfdhcp\fR
will generate the REQUEST packets\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
With two template files given on the command line, the first will be used as the pattern for SOLICIT packets, the second as the pattern for REQUEST packets\&.
.RE
.PP
(Similar determination applies to DHCPv4\*(Aqs DISCOVER and REQUEST packets\&.)
.PP
The template file holds the DHCP packet represented as a stream of ASCII hexadecimal digits and it excludes any IP/UDP stack headers\&. The template file must not contain any characters other than hexadecimal digits and spaces\&. Spaces are discarded when the template file is parsed (so in the file, \*(Aq12B4\*(Aq is the same as \*(Aq12 B4\*(Aq which is the same as \*(Aq1 2 B 4\*(Aq)
.PP
The template files should be used in conjunction with the command line parameters which specify offsets of the data fields being modified in outbound packets\&. For example, the
\fB\-E \fR\fB\fItime\-offset\fR\fR
switch specifies the offset of the DHCPv6 Elapsed Time option in the packet template\&. If the offset is specified, perfdhcp will inject the current elapsed time value into this field before sending the packet to the server\&.
.PP
In many scenarios,
\fBperfdhcp\fR
needs to simulate multiple clients (having unique client identifier)\&. Since packets for each client are generated from the same template file, it is necessary to randomize the client identifier (or HW address in DHCPv4) in the packet created from it\&. The
\fB\-O \fR\fB\fIrandom\-offset\fR\fR
option allows specification of the offset in the template where randomization should be performed\&. It is important to note that this offset points to the end (not the beginning) of the client identifier (or HW address field)\&. The number of bytes being randomized depends on the number of simulated clients\&. If the number of simulated clients is between 1 and 255, only one byte (to which randomization offset points) will be randomized\&. If the number of simulated clients is between 256 and 65535, two bytes will be randomized\&. Note, that two last bytes of the client identifier will be randomized in this case: the byte which randomization offset parameter points to, and the one which precedes it (random\-offset \- 1)\&. If the number of simulated clients exceeds 65535, three bytes will be randomized; and so on\&.
.PP
Templates may be currently used to generate packets being sent to the server in 4\-way exchanges, i\&.e\&. SOLICIT, REQUEST (DHCPv6) and DISCOVER, REQUEST (DHCPv4)\&. They cannot be used when RENEW or RELEASE packets are being sent\&.
